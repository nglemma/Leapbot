Careers Fair
This is held throughout the academic year. We invite a large number of employers
from a range of industries to come along and have a stand, speak to the students,
advertise vacancies and graduate schemes etc. There are normally up to 70
employers who attend. It’s a great chance to speak to employers, do some
networking, and find out more about companies you might want to work for.
Careers and Professional Skills Workshops
We have a wide range of careers and employability workshops available each
academic year. The workshops are designed to equip you with the skills and
knowledge required to develop your future and ensure you are ready for the world of
work. They will give you the confidence to plan, apply for jobs, attend interviews and
also explore self-employment. All our workshops are 60 minutes in length and are
suitable for any student on any course. You can attend as many workshops as you
like but space is limited, so you need to book your place in advance online.
