This crib sheet is intended as a guide to Harvard referencing, please check with
your tutor for the exact format required for your work.

This guide was revised and updated in February 2016. The main amendment is the
removal of <> around URLs, most universities have dropped this practice. There have also
been slight amendments to ensure consistency in the different media types. Please see
the Harvard LEAP Online section for further examples and further details:

Techniques/Referencing/Level-2/Harvard-Referencing.aspx.


Citing in the text
In the text of your work you must cite the author or editor’s name and date of publication
each time you paraphrase or summarise from a source of information. For a direct quote
you must also include a page number, eg, (Drury, 2012, p.34).

The citation can be placed in several places in the sentence:
    I. at the beginning: Porter’s (1985) value chain model examines ...
   II. in the middle: central to service quality (Gabbott and Hogg, 1998), even though ...
  III. at the end: weaknesses in the service (Bateson and Hoffman, 1999).

N.B. For sources with more than two authors or editors, cite the first author followed by et
al., for example, the citation for the first book reference below would be (Ten Have et al.,
2003).

Secondary sources: you may refer to an author’s work which is included in a book or journal
written by another author. You need to include both authors in the text citation. You should
also include the relevant page number.

(Harry, 2001 cited in Hannagan, 2008, p. 518)

In the above example, Harry is the author of the work you are discussing and Hannagan is
the author of the book containing the summary of Harry’s work. In the reference list or
bibliography you should only include a reference to the author of the actual book you have
read, in this case, Hannagan.


Citing in the reference list or bibliography
Your references should be listed alphabetically by author’s name. The following list shows
some examples of sources you may use. There are many more examples given in the
Harvard section of LEAP Online, see above.
