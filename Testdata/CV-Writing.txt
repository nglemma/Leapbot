CV Writing
A CV is a clear and focused overview of education, work experience and skills which
is used when applying for vacancies. A covering letter accompanies your CV when
sent off to an employer. When writing a CV, it is hard to know what goes where - but
this guide will show you the basics.
CV Layout
Personal Details. The best place to start with a CV is you! Include your name,
address and contact details. Put these at the top of the page.
Personal profile. Then move onto a short personal profile. It is used to provide the
reader with a brief outline of your motivation for applying and your unique selling
points.
Education: in reverse-chronological order (i.e. most recent first) include your place
of study, subject and grades.
Skills profile (if doing a skills-based CV) You can develop skills through paid
experience, the Bolton Award, work shadowing, university work and clubs and
societies. Make sure you can provide evidence for the skills you include by stating
where you have used them, and highlight those that are most relevant to the job you
are applying for.
Work history and/or voluntary experience. List all relevant, previous roles. These
should be in reverse order with the most recent first. Make sure that you list some of
the duties held in your job role, as well as any positions of responsibility. These will
show what you are capable of.
Additional information / achievements. Here you can include any additional
pieces of information which you are unable to include elsewhere on your CV e.g.
Driving Licence, recent DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service) check, language skills,
customer care training etc.
Hobbies and interests. If relevant and if you have space towards the end of your
CV, you can include hobbies and interests. Try to promote creative and team
activities, or interests that are relevant to the role. As your employment record grows,
this should take less precedence.

References. It is good practice to have details of at least two referees. These are
used to prove you are who you say you are, as well as what you are claiming to have
achieved. These can be previous employers or tutors. Just ensure you have asked
their permission before listing them. If you’re running low on space, you can simply
say they are ‘available on request’.
Hints and Tips
Always read through and check your CV. Make sure all details, grammar and
spellings are correct. You may wish to ask a Careers Adviser to check it for you
before sending to an employer.

Don’t re-use a CV, it might suggest you don’t care about the job or don’t pay
attention to detail
Remember a standard CV should be no more than 2 sides of A4 paper
You can always change the order of the sections within your CV by placing
the things you believe to be most relevant first
