What we cannot do
We do not recommend students to employers: we can help you to find out about
employers and to make applications for jobs, but we do not have any special
influence with employers.
We are happy to give advice on the structure and content of application forms and
CVs, but we cannot write it for you.
We are not qualified to give detailed advice about your entitlement to work in the UK.
We offer advice and information in good faith. YOU must take responsibility for your
decisions based on that guidance.
Finding out about job vacancies
The Careers team manage thousands of vacancies each year. We have extensive
links with employers and all available opportunities, including jobs, placements,
internships and volunteering opportunities, are advertised via the following link:

What to do if you are unsure about your future career plans
The Careers and Employment Service exists to help people with little or no idea of
what they want to do after graduation as well as those who have already developed
career plans. The Careers team supports students and recent graduates at all
stages of the career planning and job search process.
