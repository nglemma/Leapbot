What is a Journals Club?
A Journals Club can be a great way of practicing how to evaluate and critically
analyse journal articles and research or experiments in a friendly, non-pressured
environment.
How can they help me in my academic studies?
They can help in developing important research skills in time for your dissertation!
That’s great but how do they work?





Journals Clubs can last from 30 mins to an hour
Each session, a different person selects a journal article of their choice and
shares it with the other members of the group
Each member reads the article and critically evaluates it ready for the group
session
The group session consists of individuals contributing to the discussion of
evaluating the journal article

It’s a bit like a Book Club but you are evaluating more academic and scholarly
material rather than something like a popular fiction title.

How do we analyse and critically evaluate?
Members should cover:






Summarising the aim/method/results/conclusions in a few sentences and in
their own words
Listing the strengths of the study relating to the significance, method, results
or conclusions made
Noting the weaknesses of the study relating to the significance, method,
results or conclusions made
Any changes they would make to the study to strengthen it
Any further study ideas the member has generated from reading the study

How does this impact and strengthen my academic skills?
Attending or running a Journal Club promotes:







The continual reading of scientific and subject related material
The summarising of information into one’s own words
The critical evaluation of published research
The development of new ideas based on read information
The widening of student subject matter through the reading of different articles
from different subject aspects
The creation of new friendships with peers with a similar interest in the
research field

All of which are vital for career development and a successful dissertation!
Now I understand the value of a Journals Club how can I attend one?
Now you know what’s involved you could form your own Journals Club with your
peers, this would be a great way of studying together and peer-learning.
Or if you work in a profession that promotes Journals Clubs i.e. Health Care why not
see if your Trust has one which you can attend?
How can the Library support me in running or setting up a Journals Club?
The Library can help you in several ways, we could:





Offer a study space or room in the Library for you to run a club
Support you in finding journal articles for your group to analyse
Attend the session and offer advice around critical evaluation of the research
Recommend some great books around critiquing which will enhance your
skills
