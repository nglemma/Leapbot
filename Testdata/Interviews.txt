Interviews
To be shortlisted for an interview means that you have successfully completed an
application form or produced an effective CV which has enabled you to stand out
from the crowd, and meet the job criteria as specified by the employer. The employer
must be impressed enough to want to find out more about you and to take your
application to the next stage of the selection process.
Being interviewed for a job can sometimes feel daunting, however thorough planning
and preparation can give you the confidence to help you to be successful.
The interview is a two way interaction. The employer wants to see if you are the right
candidate for the role but, equally, it is also your chance to see if you would be
happy to work for them. The interview process isn’t about trying to trip you up or
catch you out, it is about finding out what you are good at. It is an opportunity for you
to breathe life into your application form or CV.

Preparation for an Interview
You should consider the following steps in readiness for your interview:
Research the employer: read any literature there is about the employer. Do not go in
‘cold’. Always look at basic information such as company size, locations, products
and services offered, turnover, organisational structures and competitors. Find out if
the company has been in the news recently and why. Check out the company /
organisations’ website, broadsheet newspapers, relevant professional journals and

professional bodies. Then you should look for more detail about the position and
department you are seeking to join.
Research the job sector: commercial awareness is extremely important so before
you go for your interview look at developments within that particular sector i.e.
financial downturns, changes to legislation etc. Try and think about how this could
affect their organisation and impact on the role for which you are applying.
Understand the role you are applying for: this may seem like an obvious point, but
feedback from many employers would suggest that candidates don’t always prepare
enough and sometimes don’t even seem to know what job they have applied for!
Read over the job descriptions and specification. If possible, try and speak to the
person who is currently doing the job, or someone in the same department.
Re-visit your application form: when applying for a job always remember to keep a
copy of your application form. Read this again before you attend your interview, as
the organisation may pick up on information that you have given. Think again about
why you want the job and how your skills, knowledge and experience match against
the requirements of the role.
Prepare answers: try and anticipate what you think the questions will be; you can do
this by looking at the job specification. Try and practice beforehand by arranging a
mock interview with a Careers Adviser.
Prepare some questions to ask: always prepare some questions that you can ask
the employer at the interview. Time is usually allocated for this at the end of the
formal questions, but this will be made clear to you on the day. Asking questions
creates a favourable impression and will enable you to understand more about the
role.
Be sure to know why you find the job interesting: most employers will ask you why
you are interested in working for them. Be sure to have a genuine and well
researched answer planned.

Practical Preparation
Plan your journey: always make sure you know where you are going. Work out your
journey time and always try to arrive 15 minutes early. If possible, drive to your
destination a few days before your interview to familiarise yourself with the journey
and the route, and always try to allow for traffic and unscheduled delays. Print off a
map if needed. It is also a good idea to take a contact name and number with you in
case you are delayed for any reason.
Check out exactly where your interview will be held, the building, floor, room number
etc. Multiple businesses may be located in one building or across different sites.

Dress appropriately: make sure you have a smart outfit that is clean, as an interview
is a formal occasion. Do not wear jewellery or accessories that are too distracting.
Use common sense where piercings and tattoos are concerned. If you are unable to
remove them, try and ensure studs remain small and any offensive body art is
covered.
What to take with you: it may be a good idea to take a copy of your CV and
application form as a reference/guide; also any relevant portfolios (particularly if you
are applying for a role within the creative industries) and your certificates. It is
acceptable to write questions down that you would like to ask and take them in with
you. Whatever you do take into the interview room, make sure it is presented in a
professional wallet or document folder.
If you have a disability: you will need to address the issue of disclosing your disability
to the employer before the interview.

The Interview
Controlling your Nerves
Everyone feels a little nervous before an interview. In order to remain calm, the best
advice is to prepare as much as you can before the day. Mock interviews can be
arranged with a Careers Adviser in advance, which will help you to familiarise
yourself with the process. This is also a good way of gaining feedback on your
overall performance. Try and ensure you get a good night’s sleep, set your alarm
and make sure you leave yourself plenty of time to get to the interview. All
interviewers are aware of how nerve-wracking an interview can be, so they should
try to put you at ease.
On entering the interview room shake hands with the interviewer if appropriate and,
when invited to do so, take a seat. Try to sit up straight and avoid slouching. Speak
clearly and calmly. It is natural to feel nervous before an interview but you need to
show that you can manage any anxiety. If an employer is looking for someone who
can cope with pressure then the interview is a good guide for them.

Body Language
Body language is extremely important in an interview situation. The way you enter
the room, your handshake, the way you sit, all give signals about your confidence,
your interest and your manners. Although you will not be marked against this
criterion it will be duly noted by the employer. Smiling is essential, and helps to strike
up and maintain rapport with the interviewers. Try not to wave your hands around too
much.

Maintain eye contact. Looking down or away from the interviewer can make you
appear disinterested or insincere. With panel interviews, the best advice is to look at
and answer the person asking the question, with a glance from time to time at the
other interviewers to include them in your reply.

Interview Questions
By now you should have undertaken your research in preparation for your interview
and will hopefully have a very good idea about the technical knowledge, experience
and skills required for the role. The questions you will be asked will be based around
these criterion.
Employers ask questions that are traditionally designed to help them understand you
as a person: to gauge your motivation levels, your experience, your skills and certain
aspects of your personality that may have an impact on your overall performance.
They will have already been provided with a synopsis of this information from your
CV or application form, so they are looking to clarify information within the interview
process.
The following information describes the types of questions you are likely to get asked
in a graduate interview:

Warm Up Questions
These are asked at the beginning of the interview and are designed to put you at
ease. Common warm up questions are ‘Tell me about yourself?’ or ‘Why have you
applied for the position?’ Keep your answers short and succinct aligning your
experience to the role and highlighting your interest in the position/organisation. The
interviewer can tell a lot about your personality from the way you respond.

Competency-Based Questions
Competency based questions provide employers with an idea of how you might
perform in the workplace by asking questions that test how you have reacted to and
dealt with previous academic, work or social situations. The questions will be
focused upon your skills and will relate to the person specification of the job. You will
be asked to give an example of a situation or task which led you to take a certain
course of action. Probing questions will then be used by the interviewer to determine
the course of action you took, what changes were created by those actions, and the
effects of those actions on you and/or others.

When preparing for this type of questioning remember the STAR approach:
Situation – describe the situation that relates to the question being asked.
Task – what tasks did you identify that needed to be completed?
Action – what action did you take?
Result – How did you know that your actions where successful?

Ensure you choose examples that are as relevant to the role as possible, that were
challenging and really show off your skills. Avoid saying ‘we’ to describe actions
taken in a team, as the employer is not recruiting the team but needs to be clear
what ‘you’ specifically contributed.

Your Questions to the Interviewer
It is normal for an interviewer to ask you if you have any questions at the end of an
interview. Preparing some questions to ask the employer is a good way to show that
you are keen and enthusiastic about working for the company. If you don’t ask any
questions some recruiters may interpret this as disinterest. It is advisable to ask
between 1-3 questions at the end of the interview. If the interview panel have already
covered the information as part of the process, let them know that all of your
questions have been answered adequately.

Online Interviews
More and more employers are moving their interviews online as a result of the recent
pandemic. You should prepare for an online interview in a similar way to a face-toface interview.
