Careers and Professional Skills
Careers and professional skills as a term, is often used as ‘short-hand’ to describe a
set of employability skills, attitudes and attributes that a person may have or develop
in order to secure a job:




Skill = a type of work/activity which requires specialist training and knowledge
Attitude = a way of thinking, feeling or behaving which reflects a state of mind
and contributes to a person’s personality
Attribute = an inherent quality or strength

Definitions of Employability
Employability focuses on enhancing the academic, personal and professional
development of learners to meet the changing needs of employers, the economy and
society. Over the last 20 years, definitions of employability have shifted towards a
more holistic view of ‘graduate attributes’ that include transferable skills and personcentred qualities, developed in conjunction with subject specific knowledge, skills
and competencies.
“Being able to get a job, keep a job, and if necessary find another job.”
Carl Gilleard - Association of Graduate Recruiters

Developing Careers and Professional Skills, Attitudes and Attributes
Through Academic Study
Your university experience has value in several contexts beyond just your course.
Consider aspects of your time at university such as your subject specific knowledge,
any membership of academic societies and/or professional bodies, discussions of
professional ethical values and relevant legislation. Tutors also help you identify
what employability skills, attitudes and attributes you develop through the use of
Learning Objectives.
To help you construct a Personal Development Plan (PDP), you should actively
reflect, review and take part in career planning activities. A useful strategy is to
record your skills and achievements as you go along. You will then have a rich bank
of evidence to withdraw from to use for applications and interviews.

Transferable Skills
Usually picked up over a period of time, transferable skills are developed in one
situation and can be transferred to another situation. They can be gained from
previous job positions, charity or voluntary work and even your hobbies and can be
applied to a range of jobs and industries. Not only do they show that you’d be a good
fit for the team, they can also demonstrate what a candidate can bring to a role, and
how much they’ve learnt from previous positions or experiences. They also enable
you to apply for work and training beyond your subject specialism if necessary.
There are so many skills that could be classed as transferable, and every individual
will have their own ‘set’, with natural ability and aptitude towards certain skills. All
employers will be looking for something different, but some of the more common
ones that are often cited by employers include: communication, team work,
numeracy, organisation, time management, problem solving, flexibility, initiative,
commercial awareness, leadership and the use of ICT.

Experience of Work
Real work experience is essential for you to develop your skills and you can also
check out a potential industry that you are interested in. You should consider the
skills you are interested in developing further and then choose an appropriate
context from which to gain that experience.
Work experience is really important, even if you are employed in a shop or working
in a bar, there are transferable skills that you can draw upon such as customer
service, communication skills, numeracy, time management, flexibility etc. If you do
not have any work experience yet, it is highly recommended that you gain some
whilst at university to increase your employability skills.

Through Extra Curricular Activities
During the application process it is important that you articulate all the skills you have
gained, and not just those from work or study. You may have been involved in a
student society or club, or held a position of responsibility within the University such
as a Student Representative or Student Ambassador. Even at the University of
Bolton, you can undertake paid and voluntary opportunities to enhance you
employability skills.

Voluntary Work
Many students acquire a range of transferable skills from undertaking voluntary
work. Evidence of voluntary work is increasingly cited as being important to
employers (The Brathay Trust, Guardian Careers, 2014). Consider choosing an
opportunity that has meaning to you in order to engage fully with the experience.

Understanding your Individual Attitudes and Attributes
Two fifths of bosses surveyed by The Brathay Trust, (Guardian Careers 2014)
suggested as well as wanting to know about graduates skills they also wanted to
gain an understanding of the personal qualities and strengths of graduates. It
revealed that a strong work ethic, commitment, resilience and motivation are the
traits recruiting managers look out for most. It is important that individuals
understand their own individual strengths and attitudes

Networking and Social Media
University follow-up of graduates via the annual, national Destination of Leavers from
Higher Education (DLHE) Survey, evidences a strong trend in the importance of
networking skills and ‘mining’ personal and professional contacts to source
employment. The effective use of social media has become more important and
increasingly used by employers for recruitment purposes. It is now viewed as
essential to have a LinkedIn profile and to be actively using LinkedIn. It is also a
useful way of finding employment opportunities and gaining commercial awareness.

So can I enhance my careers and professional skills at the University of
Bolton?
Yes! Look at our Graduate Attributes Matrix for Employability (GAME)
In 2017, the University of Bolton developed the Graduate Attributes Matrix for
Employability (GAME). This matrix aims to evidence the development potential that a

The Graduate attributes, as highlighted below, are the personal qualities, skills and
academic abilities that the University of Bolton community values, and that a student
should acquire during their time at this university. Graduate attributes can be
developed as part of a programme of study, as well as through the wider student
experience. The Graduate Attributes Framework has been created to allow for
personalisation by each School and subject area and tailoring for particular co- and
extra-curricular activities.

In conclusion, the term ‘employability’ can be seen as a shorthand expression of a
range of complex skills, attitudes and attributes whose component parts are:






Your subject specialism skills and knowledge
Generic transferable skills which where adapted, can be applied in different
work contexts
A range of ‘soft’ attitudes and attributes identified as important to employers
