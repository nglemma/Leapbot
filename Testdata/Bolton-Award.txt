The Bolton Award
When considering your own employability, a crucial thing to be aware of is the
difference between hard skills and soft skills.
Hard skills are the skills you will learn while completing your course. These are
practical skills such as coding, accounting or artwork. The skills you are assessed on
for your degree and are required to do the job you aspire to.
Soft skills are broader skills that apply to anyone in a working environment, like:
teamwork, time management and resilience. These skills affect how you navigate a
workplace, how you handle difficult situations and generally make you a more
rounded and employable individual.
In 2019, LinkedIn surveyed over 5,000 talent professionals in 35 countries, all to
bring people insights into current market trends and how to make yourself more
employable.
91% of the companies surveyed (including Starbucks, Cisco and Sodexo) said that
soft skills were among the most important for an applicant to have (LinkedIn Report:
Global talent trends, 2019, LinkedIn Report: These 4 Ideas Are Shaping the Future
of HR and Hiring)
The same survey found that 92% of companies surveyed said soft skills were as
important or more so than hard skills gained in university degrees (LinkedIn Report:
Global talent trends, 2019, LinkedIn Report: These 4 Ideas Are Shaping the Future
of HR and Hiring)
The Bolton Award has been designed to help you to improve these soft skills, as well
as increasing your industry awareness. You also get a certificate recognising your
accomplishments and the award will also appear on your Higher Education
Achievement Report (HEAR).
The award is in three tiers, Silver, Gold and Platinum. The Silver tier is designed to
help increase your labour market awareness, with built in self-reflection to encourage
you to think more critically about your current skills, the skills you would like to gain
and how each activity you engage in within the university and beyond helps to shape
these skills.

The Gold tier helps you to focus more on your specific career goal, by:
•
•
•
•

Setting targets
Building experience and enrichment hours to improve a CV
Attending workshops
Building a CV and a mock interview

You will also be able to build up skills in an online skills journal, which can you refer
back to when the time comes for you to apply for a job and prepare for an interview.
The Platinum tier focuses more on skills for graduate level roles, such as;
psychometric testing, self-presentation and honest self-reflection on the journey and
the skills gained and lessons learned.
You can start the Bolton Award whenever you like, and have the entirety of your
study to complete it. You must complete Silver before progressing to Gold, and you
must complete Gold before your final year to begin Platinum. Progression is not
mandatory, each stage has a certificate so if you are happy to stop at Silver, you
don’t have to progress to Gold.
Upon completing the Bolton Award, you will have:
• A CV checked by the careers and employability team
• A SMART target for your next steps towards your career
• An online journal of your skills with examples of activities you completed
• A mock application process from form to interview with feedback on each step
• A certificate to mark your accomplishment
• A recognized award on your HEAR
