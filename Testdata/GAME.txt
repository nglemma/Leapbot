Graduate Attributes Matrix for Employability (GAME)
The University of Bolton has developed the Graduate Attributes Matrix for
Employability (GAME), which provides an overview of the key skills it expects all
graduates to leave University with.
GAME is used by the Careers Team to help you self-assess where you are in terms
of employability skills and attributes. This model should be used to assess your
professional development during your time at university and provide you with a
foundation for the start of your career.
The Graduate attributes are:




Symbolic of what it means to be a University of Bolton graduate
Not simply taught in the classroom but fostered through meaningful
experiences and as a result of continuous learning and reflection
Unique to every student – in terms of their starting point, experiences,
development and comprehension

The GAME model comprises 10 attributes:
1. Self-aware
To have a clear perception of your personality, strengths, weaknesses, thoughts,
beliefs, motivations and emotions, and how these can affect your subsequent
decisions and behaviours through self-reflection.
2. Resilient
To utilise effective coping strategies to withstand, learn from or recover quickly from
difficult, stressful and challenging situations.
3. Problem solver
To use a range of techniques and consider a number of options in a systematic
manner, to find positive solutions to challenging problems posed.
4. Effective Communicator
To actively listen, share information, provide direction and express ideas and
feelings effectively through a range of different forms (verbally, visually and written)
so that the intended message is successfully delivered, received, understood and
responded to.

5. Global Citizen
To understand, respect and embrace diversity, different cultures and different ways
of working, and to recognise the global issues that affect us.
6. Enterprising
To demonstrate, creativity, innovation, initiative and resourcefulness, and be ready to
act as opportunities present themselves.
7. Adaptable
To be flexible and responsive to change in any given situation or work environment,
or in response to the needs, wishes or demands of others.
8. Collaborative
To develop a purposeful relationship/team with two or more people to constructively
explore ideas and achieve shared goals.
9. Confident
To be able to demonstrate a firm belief in yourself and your abilities.
10. Lifelong Learner
To evaluate personal performance and independently seek and act upon means of
improvement to allow for the advancement of skills and knowledge for personal or
professional reasons.

Evidencing your skills
Consider your USP (unique selling point). What are your unique strengths, skills,
attributes, attitudes and experiences which will help to distinguish you in the job
market? Do you have good, relevant examples for each GAME attribute?
Rather than viewing this as a tick list you will address on one occasion you should
make an assessment of where you are at this point in time, set your goals and
determine what needs to be done in order to get that dream job. You can find tools
on Studenthub that explain each attribute in detail and allow you to decide how you
have demonstrated this.
By developing an action plan now to address GAME, you will significantly increase
your employability skills which will help you to enter your chosen profession.

So how do employers know I have these skills?
Many employers will assess applicants against a range of criteria. There may be a
job specification which will make this explicit. If not, you will need to identify the
competencies the employer requires through the advert, job description and your
research into the company.
In order to prove that you possess these skills you will need to provide evidence to
support your claim: it is not enough to say that you can do something – you have to
prove it. Show not tell!
This is where all the work experience you have undertaken reaps its reward. Think
about:




The part time work you have taken on
The voluntary work you signed up for
Elements of your academic studies.

All need to be carefully considered.

Evidencing GAME in the recruitment process
Once you have developed your action plan and looked at your examples for each it
is a good idea to include these examples during the recruitment process.
One of the best ways to do this is by using the STAR technique. This allows you to
think about a Situation, the Task you had to perform and then the Actions you took
(be careful to highlight your role rather than that of the group) and finally but
importantly the Result, where it would be useful if you could give a quantifiable
example using numbers (maybe a mark for an assignment) or some qualitative
feedback from a line manager.
STAR is detailed within the Application Forms LEAP Online section but it is an
excellent way to demonstrate your graduate attributes throughout the recruitment
process.
STAR is especially useful on applications and when answering competency-based
interview questions such as:





Tell us about a time you have been an effective team member (Collaborative)
How did you manage a situation when something did not go to plan?
(Problem solver)
Tell us about a time when you have been innovative (Creativity)
When and how have you communicated a message effectively? (Effective
Communicator)

Hopefully you are now fully familiar with the 10 attributes that employers look for and
you can articulate these in the recruitment process.
If you really want to make sure you can demonstrate these attributes, we have a
range of tools on Studenthub such as the GAME self-assessment action plan and
CV and Interview 360, which will allow you to put your new found knowledge into
practice (https://studenthub.bolton.ac.uk).
You can book an appointment with the Careers and Employability Service via
Studenthub. You can also email the Careers and Employability Service at
