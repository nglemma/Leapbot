An Introduction to Academic Writing


Introduction
Academic writing can be a challenging prospect for most University students,
especially for individuals new to writing at this level. However, it is a core skill that
students at the University of Bolton need to learn, since it forms part of academic
assessment.

As outlined in the General Assessment Guidelines, which will be examined shortly,
as you advance through your course at the University, there is an expectation that
your ‘Written English’ will continue to improve. Specifically, there is a strong
emphasis on your writing style, spelling, punctuation and grammar and other
academic conventions.

Furthermore, depending on the task, you will be expected to adapt your writing style.
For example, University of Bolton assessments incorporate different writing styles,
whereby you may be asked to flip between personal reflections to a critical analysis.
Therefore, it is important that you have the underpinning knowledge to help you
move between the different writing styles and achieve the higher-grades.

If all of this sounds slightly alien to you right now, please do not worry. This Tutorial
aims to introduce you to academic writing with a definition and the main
characteristics and steps you can take to start developing your academic writing
skills.

What is Academic Writing?
                                           Pause and Reflect

                                           Think about what the following words have
                                           in common.

                                                •   Journal Article
                                                •   Narrative/story
                                                •   Poem
                                                •   Letter
                                                •   Diary entry
                                                •   Research projects
                                                •   Reflective writing

They are all different types of writing!

As demonstrated by the above list, we write for a variety of reasons. Therefore, it’s
important that we adjust our writing to ensure it is suitable for the audience.
Academic writing is no different.

The term ‘academic writing’ can be defined as writing that will allow you to
communicate your ideas and opinion, information and research to the academic
community at the University and beyond (English Academic Purpose, 2021).

At the University of Bolton, students are largely assessed on their ability to write,
therefore, academic writing skills are a fundamental component of academic
success.

To demonstrate learning throughout your studies, you may be required to produce
different types of writing, for example: essays, reports, dissertations, action research
projects, blogs, vlogs, etc. While each programme has specific writing conventions
and types of discourse, there are some general characteristics of scholarly work.




     Let’s look at these characteristics in greater detail.

Clear Focus and Planning




Firstly, effective academic writing can be characterised by the clear focus to define
the purpose of your writing. In other words, you are required to write for a specific
purpose.

To achieve this aim, you will need to carry out in-depth research into the topic area,
from which you can plan your assignment accordingly.

The Module Guide, which you will receive at the beginning of a new module, will help
you to prepare and answer the learning outcomes set for you.

As you will note from the Module Guide, formal academic writing tasks at the
University are set by, and written for, academic staff or assessors, and there is clear
criteria against which your work will be marked. The General Assessment
Guidelines, which can be found within the Module Guide, set out the marking criteria
for your level of study.




   The next section of the Academic Writing tutorial will
   provide useful tips to help you plan your assignment.

Consider the Audience




The reader of your assignment is also known as the ‘audience.’ We communicate
differently with different people we meet.

When you’re writing, try to imagine you’re writing for a larger audience, who might:

   •   Not have the same level of subject knowledge as your Module Tutor.
   •   Not have the same level of experience as you.

By having these points and the audience in mind, will help you to structure your
writing appropriately. There's more on this area later in this LEAP Online section.




 In the next section we will explore different genres and
      writing styles used at the University of Bolton.

Genres and Writing Styles




As part of the writing process, you will need to consider the genre of writing e.g., an
essay and the writing style e.g., a reflective essay, including the structure and format
of the same.

University of Bolton students will be asked to write using different genres and writing
styles, including, but not limited to:

   •   Essay writing
   •   Reflective essay
   •   Report writing
   •   Descriptive writing
   •   Comparative analysis/evaluation
   •   Argumentative writing

Let’s look at the different genres and writing styles above in more detail.

An Introduction to Academic Writing


Essay writing
1. Definition

According to Cottrell (2019) an essay is defined as an assignment that is intended to
focus your reading and thinking on a specific area. Often, you will engage in a critical
analysis on a topic area that will require you to present your position on the topic by
forming a compelling argument.



2. Purpose

   •   Essays will allow you to:
   •   Present your ideas on a subject
   •   Elaborate on your ideas
   •   Develop your communication skills
   •   Write with greater precision
   •   Develop writing skills that will support you at University and in work-related
       contexts.

As you progress through your studies, the standard of expectations on essay writing
will rise and may include more complex subjects that will challenge your higher order
thinking skills e.g., to critically analyse. (Cottrell, 2019)



3. Structure

The structure often derives from the genre of writing (English Academic Purpose,
2021). Generally, if you're asked to write an essay, it should include an introduction,
with the main body separated into focused paragraphs, finishing with a conclusion.
Generally, organisational features, such as bullet points and subheadings are
excluded.

4. Preliminaries

Title page

Purpose

Students at the University of Bolton are expected to include a title page that contains
key information that helps the reader to identify the contents and author of their work.

Structure

Generally, a title page should include the following information: Programme name

Module title Assessment title Your student number Your marking tutor Date of
submission

Always check with your Module Tutor to ensure all information has been included.



5. Introduction

Some experienced academic writers believe writing an introduction can be the
hardest part and, although it is found at the beginning, it is often easier to complete
this part last to make sure all key points are included.

Purpose

In short, when writing your introduction, it should:

   •   Outline the direction of your assignment and argument
   •   Provide contextual and background information on the topic
   •   Explain the overall structure

Structure

It’s important to remember that there is no one way to structure your introduction, but
most will include the following parts.

 Part                               Details
 General Statement                      •   Usually found at the beginning of the
                                            introduction.
                                        •   Will help you to introduce the general topic
                                            and give the reader contextual and
                                            background information.
                                        •   If you’re writing a short essay, this may
                                            include 1 or 2 lines.
                                        •   For longer essays, you may choose to
                                            include definitions, outline the main topic
                                            and separate over 1 or more paragraphs.


 Thesis Statement                       •   Usually found at the end of the
                                            introduction.
                                        •   Will help you to give the reader clear
                                            information about the content of your
                                            essay.
                                        •   Will help you to outline your main ideas on
                                            the topic and your stance/ argument.
                                        •   It may also include an outline, as detailed
                                            below.

 Outline                                •   Will help you to explain to the reader how
                                            your assignment will be structured e.g. in
                                            chronological order.




Example

[General statement] The introduction is an important component of any genre of
academic writing. [Thesis statement] The Introduction will help the reader to
understand the direction of the assignment, provide contextual and background
information on the topic and explain the overall structure. [Outline] This essay will
examine the purpose and structure of a well-written introduction and conclude that,
unless the writer achieves this, the reader will find it extremely difficult to understand
what the writing is about.

6. Main Body

The main body, or the main part to your essay, is a collection of paragraphs, all of
which relate the to the topic.

Purpose

To present, explore and develop your ideas and argument.

Structure

The main body should be logically sequenced to ensure the reader can follow and
understand your work. The main body of your essay must include well-constructed
paragraphs. For more information on structuring your paragraphs, see the next
section, ‘Putting it all together’



7. Conclusion

In contrast to the introduction, the conclusion should be relatively straightforward. By
this point in the writing process, your main ideas and argument should already be set
out in the main body of your essay. Therefore, all you need to do is summarise your
essay and add a concluding comment on the topic.

Purpose

   •   To bring all of your main ideas together and set out your overall position
   •   Highlight gaps or weaknesses and make recommendations for future
       research

Structure

 Summarise your essay                 •   Have a clear transitional signal. For
                                          instance, “In conclusion…” to tell to the
                                          reader this is the end of your essay.
                                      •   Summarise your main ideas from the main
                                          body of your essay.
                                      •   Remind the reader of your thesis
                                          statement (your stance/argument).
                                      •   Refer back to your thesis statement in the
                                          introduction.
                                      •   Do not include any new research, ideas or
                                          arguments.

                                   Tip: If you have written your thesis statement at
                                   this point, you may find it easier to produce a
                                   restatement of your thesis statement, albeit using
                                   different words.

 Concluding statement              Your concluding comment may:

                                      •   Highlight any gaps or weakness in
                                          research.
                                      •   Propose a solution to any issues identified
                                          in the main body.
                                      •   Make recommendations for future
                                          research.




Example

[Summarise] In conclusion, this essay has considered the importance of a well-
written introduction, emphasising key components, such a general comment, thesis
statement and outline will help the reader to understand the direction of the
assignment. [Concluding statement] If writers begin to follow this process and
incorporate the key components noted above, then some of the problems often
faced in academic writing can be lessened.

8. Additional Matters

You should also include:

   •   Reference list
   •   Bibliography
   •   Appendices
   •   A word-count (at the end of the assessment, excluding references, figures
       and appendices)




Reflective Essay
1. Definition

Draws on personal experiences by critically analysing an experience, demonstrating
how it affected you, linking back to theory.



2. Purpose

During your time at the University of Bolton, it is most likely you will be required to
write a reflective essay, in which you reflect on academic or work-based placements,
evaluate an experiment or simply a reflection on literature that links theory to
practice. However, it can often to prove difficult to write about your feelings and be
critical of your actions.

This piece of work will allow you to reflect on an event and demonstrate to the
audience what you have learnt from it. It is an opportunity for you to explain what
happened, briefly express your feelings and what you have learnt and how you could
do things differently next time.

Needless to say, therefore, this style of writing will not only help you in an academic
context, but develop important skills that will support you in your chosen profession
once you commence employment.

3. Writing Styles

Reflective essays include a number of styles, including:

Critical
Include academic reasoning on your experience and how it relates to theory or
professional practice

Descriptive
Describe, succinctly your experience.

Evaluative
This may include an evaluation of your role.

Analytical
Choose and explain key events during your experience.



4. Choose a Topic

Before you begin to structure your assignment, you need to choose a topic.
Remember, although you’re writing about a personal experience, it is still a formal
piece of academic writing that needs to meet the assignment brief. Therefore, you
need to choose a topic that achieves this objective and allows you to write a strong
piece of work. To help you choose a topic, you may wish to consider the following:

   •   Is the topic relevant? If not, perhaps it’s one to avoid.
   •   Does the topic relate to theory? If so, you can write about how your
       experience links back to existing literature.
   •   Did you learn something? If so, write about what you learnt as long as it links
       back to the topic.
   •   Were you inspired? Did the topic inspire you, but you can still write about it
       critically?
   •   Can the topic be analysed? For instance, are there different debates around
       the topic you can write about?

5. Structure

Your assignment brief may ask you to consider a certain model of reflection. There
are various models, all of which help you to reflect but may have different sections.
For the purpose of this Tutorial, Gibbs (1988) has been used. Other models include
Driscoll (1994) that considers ‘What? So What? Now What?’ whereby, if you use this
model, you will need to structure your assignment slightly differently. As a general
rule, always check your assignment brief to see whether you have been instructed to
use a certain model of reflection.

Gibbs (1988) considers six stages of reflection, all of which will help you to structure
your assignment. These are:

11. Conclusion

You might want to comment on the following:

   •   What you could have done differently
   •   If the experience was negative, is there anything you would do to avoid the
       situation from happening or prevent it from happening again?
   •   If the experience was positive, would you do the same next time? Are there
       any long-term effects?
   •   Link to theories, if necessary



12. Action Plan

You might want to comment on the following:

   •   The Action Plan will summarise any action you will need to take for next time
   •   State what you learnt. Did you take anything away from the experience?
   •   What is the broader significance? Are there any lessons to be learnt from your
       experience that affects the profession of your programme, for students or
       existing theories?
   •   Do you need to attend additional training to support your learning?
   •   Do you need to seek advice from your mentor?
   •   If the situation arises again, will you be in a better position to cope with it?



13. Be Critical

It is important to draw on your personal reflection critically, by:

   •   Not being too descriptive e.g., don’t write a story about an event.
   •   Using your experience as a starting point, but don’t forget to branch out into
       your reading and include theories
   •   State whether your experience is common or uncommon?
   •   You want to be critical but you should maintain confidentiality. For example, if
       you’re a Trainee Teacher or student Nurse, ensure you delete names of

       students, patients and/or Trusts, etc. you work at. If you’re unsure, always
       check with your Module Tutor.



14. Useful Tips

   •   Be selective – you can’t include everything
   •   Avoid irrelevance; use examples which link to wider reading, which are
       relevant to the assignment brief
   •   Limit your emotions. If needed, be critical about your experience, but avoid
       emotional outpourings
   •   Personal pronouns, such as ‘I,’ ‘me’ and ‘my’ can be used Avoid repetition
   •   Demonstrate self-awareness and an awareness for others



15. Additional Matters

You should also include:

   •   Reference list
   •   Bibliography
   •   Appendices

Report Writing
1. Definition

According to EAP (2022) a report presents and analyses information with a clear
structure.



2. Purpose

This genre of academic writing is usually saved for presenting the results of an
experiment or investigation (EAP, 2022).

Reports are structured slightly differently to an essay, as it may contain sub-
headings, graphs, charts and tables. Let’s take a look at the structure of a report in
greater details.



3. Structure

Generally, the structure of a report will be similar for all disciplines at the University
of Bolton. For the purpose of this Tutorial, a typical structure, using the AIMRaD
format (Abstract, Introduction, Methodology, Results and Discussion) has been
detailed below.

It is important that you refer to your Module Guide and Tutor to ensure you structure
and format your report correctly.



4. Preliminaries

Descriptive Writing
1. Definition

You may find that most of your assignments at the University of Bolton will include
an element of descriptive writing. You may need to write a description about an
experience, a situation you may have handled during your time on placement,
emotions you have felt, a place, individual or even an object. While this style of
writing will allow you more freedom to write, it is important that you do not give too
much detail and neglect the purpose.

Comparative Analysis/evaluation
1. Definition

Usually takes up the form of an essay, through which you will need to compare and
contrast two things.



2. Purpose

During your time at the University, you maybe asked to write an essay in which you
compare and contrast two:

   •   Theories/ Theorists

An Introduction to Academic Writing


Analysis

   •   Contextualise and analyse the similarities and/or differences
   •   Consider their importance
   •   Are there any implications?

Evaluate

Make a judgement and state which theory is desirable. State the reasons for your
evaluation, based on an analysis of evidence.

Criteria

Ensure your work refers to the criteria used that help you arrive at your decision. For
instance, the quality of data or research.

Synthesis

To Synthesise in academic writing is about bringing diverse ideas together to arrive
at a new meaning or idea. In this context, consider the strengths of the different
approaches to establish whether there is a different way to look at the issue.



5. Tips

Find the right balance. Ensure you find the right balance when you compare and
contrast ideas.

Ensure you compare and contrast equivalent concepts. For instance, you wouldn’t
compare an orange with an apple.

Synthesising
1. Definition

Synthesising is a useful academic skill that will help you with analytical writing. To
Synthesise, it will involve combining ideas from multiple sources in your work. Unlike
paraphrasing, which focuses on one author (or idea/ academic source), synthesising
will draw on a range of academic sources to find ideas that are similar or
contradictory to establish a new idea to support your argument.



2. Purpose

Synthesising will help you to explain ideas from multiple sources or draw together
particular themes or traits. It will also help you to develop and strength your
argument(s), demonstrate you have read widely on the topic and cite and reference
multiple sources.



3. How to Synthesise

Step 1: Read

You should find and read relevant source material.

Step 2: Note-take

Make notes on all sources you use in your own words.

Step 3: Cite and reference

You must cite and reference all source material used in your writing.

Step 4: Create a grid

Using a new Microsoft Word document insert a table (on Word select ‘insert,’ ‘table’
and choose how many grids you would like. If you prefer, you can draw a grid on a
piece of paper using the same method.

                                           27
An Introduction to Academic Writing


Step 5: List your ideas

Within each grid, make a list of the main ideas from each source.

Step 6: Identify themes and arguments

Once you have done this, try to identify the common themes and arguments from
each source. If it helps, use different colours to help you do this. Let’s a look at an
example.

Learning outcome

‘Discuss why in-person learning is important and evaluate its effectiveness as a
mode of teaching compared to online learning.’

The below illustration shows where a student has created a grid and made notes on
four sources. The student has identified two common themes, being:

   1. Meaningful interactions and activities
   2. Location

The student has highlighted these themes using green (for ‘Location’) and blue for
‘Meaningful interactions and activities’).

                                                     their provision.



Step 7: Review your notes and write your argument.

The notes in the above illustration helped the writer to identify similar and
contradictory arguments. You will note how ‘Theorist D’ has a different idea around
‘Meaningful Interactions and activities,’ compared to the other Theorists. These ideas
can now be combined into a paragraph to support your argument. Remember to cite
and reference your work.

The following paragraph argues the point in-person teaching is important and it
remains an effective mode of teaching compared to teaching online.

     "(1) Teaching in-person remains an effective mode of delivery, compared to
     teaching online. Supporting the argument that in-person teaching is important,
     (2) Theorist B (2018) and Theorist A (2022) highlight that in a physical
     environment, students are able to learn together in the same location. The
     physical environment is a significant factor when teaching in-person as it allows
     for meaningful interactions between the teacher and their peers (3) (Theorist C,
     2017; Theorist B, 2018; Theorist A, 2022). However, (4) Theorist D (2022, p.5)
     argues that, despite the benefits of in-person teaching, learning online provides
     students with a richer experience as it allows students to develop their digital
     skills, learn in familiar surroundings, which in turn, will (4) ‘save time and money
     travelling to their provision.’ (5) The weight of evidence appears to suggest that
     a blended a approach to teaching will ensure the needs of all students are met.

   3. Synthesised information from three different sources. The sentence is a
       summary of their idea. You should cite them all in the same bracket, in order
       of publication date (earliest first), separated with a semi colon.
   4. Information from a single source (Theorist D) using a short quote.
   5. Concluding sentence. Links back to the overall argument and transitions to
       the next paragraph/section of the assignment.



4. Your Voice

Based on the evidence you have synthesised; it is important that your own voice
comes across in your academic writing. This can be achieved using a number of
methods. For more information on finding your own voice, please read through the
following tutorials within this LEAP Online section:

   •   An Introduction to Academic Writing (this current tutorial)
   •   Paraphrasing
   •   Other Writing Skills




Formatting
Your Module Guide will outline how to format your work. However, general University
of Bolton conventions, include:

   •   Font and Size: You should use Arial or Calibri Light, font size 12 for written
       assessments.
   •   Line spacing: double-spacing
   •   All pages should be numbered
   •   How to attach appendices

There may be other genres and writing styles not detailed above. Always refer to the
Module Guide or speak to your Module Tutor should you have queries on format and
structure.

 By this point, you should have a clear idea of the topic,
  who the audience is and how to format and structure
  your work. Now, you need to think about how you’re
                  going to put it together.

Putting it All together




Cohesion: A logical progression of your ideas)
A logical progression of your ideas will ensure that the audience can follow and
understand your writing. Using your assignment plan think about:

   •   The order in which the audience needs to know about that piece of
       information
   •   Select the main point and make sure it answers the learning outcome and is
       relevant to the argument you wish to make. If it doesn’t, revisit your plan and
       amend accordingly
   •   Once you’ve sequenced your ideas, discuss the order with a peer to get their
       thoughts and to make sure they can follow your work.

Paragraphs
A paragraph, which is made up of a set of sentences, will help you to develop your
idea and support your overall argument.

Paragraphs are an effective way to break up the text into manageable blocks for the
audience, allowing them to see how your writing develops step-by-step. Some useful
techniques you can consider when preparing a paragraph include:

1. Paragraph Introduction

You can start each paragraph with a topic sentence. For example, you may wish to
outline the intention of the paragraph and argument. This will help to signal the
purpose of the paragraph and provide the audience with an easy transition from the
previous paragraph.



2. Paragraph Main Body

The main body of your paragraph should be used to explain the topic (which was
introduced at the beginning). Evidence should be used to support your argument and
to give your interpretation of research.



3. Paragraph Conclusion

Conclude your paragraph by linking your idea to the overall argument you’re trying to
make and transition to the next paragraph.



Your paragraph can be developed using the following techniques:

An Introduction to Academic Writing


1. TEEL

The TEEL strategy is a good way to ensure your writing is well organised and easy
to follow. TEEL stands for:

Topic Sentence

As demonstrated above under ‘Paragraph Introduction’ a Topic Sentence will allow
you to outline the main idea of the paragraph.

Explain

This is an opportunity for you to explain why your main point is important and
supports your overall argument.

Evidence

Provide evidence to support your main point. Ensure you cite and reference
appropriately.

Link

Usually optional, but as demonstrated under ‘Paragraph Conclusion’ above, it will
help to link your idea to the overall argument. Furthermore, it is also an effective way
of transitioning to the next paragraph.



2. Chronological Organisation

Helps to describe a series of events, steps or observations that occur in time. For
example, if you were asked to write an essay about the history of education in the
UK since the beginning of the twentieth century, you would begin with its conception
(say, 1900    and outline significant events up to present day.




3. Spatial Organisation

Helps the audience to visualise an idea as you want them to see it, evoke the
audience’s senses and is often used in descriptive essays. For example, if you were
asked to write an essay describing objects you would find on a hospital ward, you

                                           34
An Introduction to Academic Writing


may choose to describe the items as they appear when observed. This approach will
help you to create a vivid picture for the reader.

When should I start a new paragraph?

1. New Idea or Point

You should start a new paragraph when you begin a new idea or point. If your idea
extends over several paragraphs, each new point within that idea should have its
own paragraph.

2. To Demonstrate Contrast

You can also start a new paragraph if you want to demonstrate a contrast between
information or ideas. Separate paragraphs will help to contrast the different sides of
a debate, different points of an argument, or any other difference.

3. The Audience Needs a Pause

Paragraphs also act as a short break for the audience. Adding a “pause” will help the
audience to follow your argument. It’s a good idea to add a “pause” if your paragraph
is becoming too lengthy or complex.




Transition Signals
Help to signal the relationship between ideas and help the audience to follow your
argument effectively.


           See the Academic Cohesion tutorial of this LEAP Online section for
           more information.




In the next section we will explore the value of evidence
                in your academic writing.

An Introduction to Academic Writing


Evidence




Evidence is an important feature of academic writing that helps to support your
opinion and argument. Evidence may include:

   •   Data and statistics
   •   Examples
   •   Facts
   •   Citations

Using evidence will add substance to your work, allows the audience to see you
have undertaken thorough research and helps to support your understanding of
different concepts and theories. Unless evidence is used in your writing, it may be
considered unreliable or bias.

Remember, you must cite and reference sources appropriately. Failure to do this
may result in issues with plagiarism and academic misconduct.




           To learn how cite and reference according to your school’s
           referencing policy see the ‘Referencing’ section on LEAP Online for
           more information.

An Introduction to Academic Writing


Language




Be Concise
   •   Try and limit it to one point, per sentence.
   •   Try to use succinct sentences where possible to avoid your point becoming
       lost in long, complex sentences. For example, "a man by the the name of
       Alexander Graham Bell invited... " would become "Bell invited...




Use Formal Language
For formal academic writing assignments, you should avoid:

1. Colloquialisms

An informal word or expression that is often used in everyday speech. For example,
"Donald (2022) ought [ought being the colloquialism] to be more specific regarding..."
can be replaced with "There is an opportunity for Donald (2022) to be more specific
regarding..."

An Introduction to Academic Writing


2. Contractions

The result of combining two words together, using an apostrophe. For example, the
phrase, ‘This isn’t the case’ should be presented as ‘this is not the case.’



3. Clichés

Have a general meaning or overused and no longer has a meaning. For example,
the phrase, ‘read between the lines,’ can be replaced with, ‘implicitly.’




Abbreviation
Use abbreviations where the phrase is likely to appear frequently in your paper. For
example, the Department for Education could be abbreviated to         DfE      . When you
first use a phrase that you wish to abbreviate, make sure you use the full phrase and
show the abbreviation in the parentheses immediately after. For example,
Department for Education ("DfE") or (hereafter referred to as "DfE")




Misplaced Conjunctions
In your writing, you should not start a sentence with the following words: 'or', 'and',
'but' and 'yet'.




Never use ‘You’
Although the word ‘you’ may appear in text books, websites and advertisements, it
shouldn’t be used in your academic writing.

For example:

        ‘You can increase motivation using rewards’

Instead, use a passive structure:

        ‘Motivation can be increased using rewards’

                                           38
An Introduction to Academic Writing


Or:

      ‘It is possible to increase motivation using rewards’

      Alternatively, be explicit and say who ‘you’ refers to:

      ‘Managers can increase motivation using rewards’




          For more information on using a passive structure in your writing, see
          ‘Find You Voice’ in the Paraphrasing tutorial of this LEAP Online
          section.




  Next let's explore the importance of finding your own
 voice when embarking on a piece of academic writing.

Voice




While academic theories should be incorporated into your writing; the most important
voice is your own. Academic writing provides you with an opportunity to discuss your
thoughts, opinion and understanding on the topic.




Language Functions
The use of different language functions will help your voice emerge from the writing,
especially through discussion points, interpretation of research and evaluation of
academic resources. The following functions will help with this:


 Language Functions                         For Example
 Give context                                   “Contemporary / historical research has

 Support your opinion with evidence

An Introduction to Academic Writing


Be Critical
Interpretation of the learning outcomes for your assignment can be quite diverse.
Remember, if you have a different opinion to a peer, that’s okay!

As an academic writer, you should avoid being too descriptive in your writing.
Instead, analyse and evaluate your research and make a judgement about it.

Research, theories and arguments are free to be challenged. So, don’t be afraid to
be critical! Give your opinion but make sure it’s supported with evidence.




           Useful tip

           Your argument should be detailed throughout your writing. Keep
           referring to your plan because this will help you to keep focused as
           you write your assignment. See the 'Critical Thinking' section on
           LEAP Online for more information.




Be Precise
Use clear and precise language. You may need to use specialist words in your
writing but define this vocabulary if it is not commonly used, or you need to
demonstrate understanding to the audience. Here are some useful tips:

   •   Try to pre-empt some of the questions the reader may ask when they read
       your work. Below is a table of general language, with some questions and
       synonyms, which will help you become more precise with your writing
   •   Always link the argument back to the learning outcomes

 General           Specific

      Big          Can you give a number, size or percentage? Do you mean
                   ‘significant’ or ‘important’?

     Small         Can you give a number, size or percentage? Do you mean
                   ‘insignificant’ or ‘unimportant’?

     Good          Effective, efficient, productive, successful, healthy, profitable


     Bad           Inefficient, unproductive, unsuccessful, unhealthy, unprofitable

      Get          Collect, gather, find, obtain, become




Avoid Bias
You should remain balanced. Present both sides of the argument and demonstrate
the strengths and weaknesses of these claims. This can be achieved by using
techniques, such as hedges, boosters and reporting verbs.

An Introduction to Academic Writing


Objective
The active voice is used to describe the action, using possessive adjectives and
subject pronouns, such as: ‘my,’ ‘our,’ ‘I’ and ‘we.’

However, in your academic writing, emphasis should be placed on your writing,
rather than you. Therefore, using a passive voice will help you to avoid writing as the
first-person.

Unless you are instructed otherwise, an impersonal approach, also commonly
referred to as the third-person view, should be used in your writing.



                                           Pause and Reflect

                                           Let's look at an example:

                                           The sentence below has been written in an
                                           active voice, consider how this could be
                                           rewritten in a passive voice.

                                           "In this essay, I aim to examine theories on
                                           academic writing."

                                           When you're ready, see our solution below.



Our solution

"Academic writing theories will be examined in this essay."



When you compare the passive example to the active example, you will notice how:
The sentence structure has changed, the word 'I' has been removed and the word
'examine' has been changed to 'examined'. Don't worry too much about this for now
as the Paraphrasing tutorial will provide more information on sentence structure and
how to change the active and passive voice.
