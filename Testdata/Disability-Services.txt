Disability Support Services
The disability team is located in the student centre in Eagle building and consists of
Fiona Valentine our manager, Elizabeth McGovern and Amy Dooley Disability
Advisors and Jo Morgan administrator.
The Disability team supports any student or prospective student who has a Disability.
If you aren’t sure whether your condition is a disability, then you can get in touch with
us and we can advise you on this.
Some conditions that you might not expect come under disability support. For
example, Dyslexia, ADHD, Asperger syndrome and autistic spectrum condition. In
addition, long-term health conditions such as, irritable bowel syndrome, diabetes,
chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia as well as many others.
Mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression are also applicable, as well
as other conditions that you might usually associate with disability support such as
visual and hearing impairments and physical disabilities such cerebral palsy.
If you think you have dyslexia or another specific learning difficulty but don’t have a
full diagnostic report you can get tested through a referral from the disability team. If
you are interested please contact us to speak with an advisor for information on this
and to fill in the referral forms.
What support can you get from Disability service?
This will depend very much upon the disability or condition being supported and the
individual needs of the student so comparing with other students might not
necessarily be helpful.
We would need a copy of your medical evidence. If you have a medical condition or
mental health condition we can help with supplying a medical evidence form that you
can ask your doctor to complete for you. When we have appropriate evidence we
can start looking into putting in place appropriate support for you.
If you are eligible we would encourage you to apply to your funding body such as
Student Finance England for Disabled Students’ Allowance. Through this you would
be likely to have an assessment of need. An assessment of need is a chat with an
experienced disability assessor who can find out how your condition affects you and
ask your funding body to pay for cost of support they think is appropriate to
recommend for you.
Possible support though disabled students allowance can include support workers
such as study skills tutor, mental health mentor or British sign language interpreter.
Assistive technology solutions may be recommended too, for example audio read

recording lectures. Recommendations are tailored to the Individual needs of the
student.
The disability team can also send a notification to your academic department giving
advice on appropriate inclusive teaching strategies. We can make arrangements for
alternative adjustments for examinations as appropriate such as extra time. We have
marking guidelines for SpLDs and can provide stickers to identify your work for
tutors, extended library loans and accessible parking for blue badge holders.
