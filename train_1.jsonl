However, it is a core skill that\nstudents at the University of Bolton need to learn, since it forms part of academic\nassessment.\n\nAs outlined in the General Assessment Guidelines, which will be examined shortly,\nas you advance through your course at the University, there is an expectation that\nyour \u2018Written English\u2019 will continue to improve. Specifically, there is a strong\nemphasis on your writing style, spelling, punctuation and grammar and other\nacademic conventions.\n\nFurthermore, depending on the task, you will be expected to adapt your writing style.\nFor example, University of Bolton assessments incorporate different writing styles,\nwhereby you may be asked to flip between personal reflections to a critical analysis.\nTherefore, it is important that you have the underpinning knowledge to help you\nmove between the different writing styles and achieve the higher-grades.\n\nIf all of this sounds slightly alien to you right now, please do not worry. This Tutorial\naims to introduce you to academic writing with a definition and the main\ncharacteristics and steps you can take to start developing your academic writing\nskills.\n\n\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                      University of Bolton 2023\n                                             1\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\nWhat is Academic Writing?\n                                           Pause and Reflect\n\n                                           Think about what the following words have\n                                           in common.\n\n                                                \u2022   Journal Article\n                                                \u2022   Narrative/story\n                                                \u2022   Poem\n                                                \u2022   Letter\n                                                \u2022   Diary entry\n                                                \u2022   Research projects\n                                                \u2022   Reflective writing\n\nThey are all different types of writing!\n\nAs demonstrated by the above list, we write for a variety of reasons. Therefore, it\u2019s\nimportant that we adjust our writing to ensure it is suitable for the audience.\nAcademic writing is no different.\n\nThe term \u2018academic writing\u2019 can be defined as writing that will allow you to\ncommunicate your ideas and opinion, information and research to the academic\ncommunity at the University and beyond (English Academic Purpose, 2021).\n\nAt the University of Bolton, students are largely assessed on their ability to write,\ntherefore, academic writing skills are a fundamental component of academic\nsuccess.\n\nTo demonstrate learning throughout your studies, you may be required to produce\ndifferent types of writing, for example: essays, reports, dissertations, action research\nprojects, blogs, vlogs, etc. While each programme has specific writing conventions\nand types of discourse, there are some general characteristics of scholarly work.\n\n\n\n\n     Let\u2019s look at these characteristics in greater detail.\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                       University of Bolton 2023\n                                            2\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\nClear Focus and Planning\n\n\n\n\nFirstly, effective academic writing can be characterised by the clear focus to define\nthe purpose of your writing. In other words, you are required to write for a specific\npurpose.\n\nTo achieve this aim, you will need to carry out in-depth research into the topic area,\nfrom which you can plan your assignment accordingly.\n\nThe Module Guide, which you will receive at the beginning of a new module, will help\nyou to prepare and answer the learning outcomes set for you.\n\nAs you will note from the Module Guide, formal academic writing tasks at the\nUniversity are set by, and written for, academic staff or assessors, and there is clear\ncriteria against which your work will be marked. The General Assessment\nGuidelines, which can be found within the Module Guide, set out the marking criteria\nfor your level of study.\n\n\n\n\n   The next section of the Academic Writing tutorial will\n   provide useful tips to help you plan your assignment.\n\n\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                   University of Bolton 2023\n                                           3\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\nConsider the Audience\n\n\n\n\nThe reader of your assignment is also known as the \u2018audience.\u2019 We communicate\ndifferently with different people we meet.\n\nWhen you\u2019re writing, try to imagine you\u2019re writing for a larger audience, who might:\n\n   \u2022   Not have the same level of subject knowledge as your Module Tutor.\n   \u2022   Not have the same level of experience as you.\n\nBy having these points and the audience in mind, will help you to structure your\nwriting appropriately. There's more on this area later in this LEAP Online section.\n\n\n\n\n In the next section we will explore different genres and\n      writing styles used at the University of Bolton.\n\n\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                  University of Bolton 2023\n                                             4\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\nGenres and Writing Styles\n\n\n\n\nAs part of the writing process, you will need to consider the genre of writing e.g., an\nessay and the writing style e.g., a reflective essay, including the structure and format\nof the same.\n\nUniversity of Bolton students will be asked to write using different genres and writing\nstyles, including, but not limited to:\n\n   \u2022   Essay writing\n   \u2022   Reflective essay\n   \u2022   Report writing\n   \u2022   Descriptive writing\n   \u2022   Comparative analysis/evaluation\n   \u2022   Argumentative writing\n\nLet\u2019s look at the different genres and writing styles above in more detail.\n\n\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                   University of Bolton 2023\n                                           5\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\nEssay writing\n1. Definition\n\nAccording to Cottrell (2019) an essay is defined as an assignment that is intended to\nfocus your reading and thinking on a specific area. Often, you will engage in a critical\nanalysis on a topic area that will require you to present your position on the topic by\nforming a compelling argument.\n\n\n\n2. Purpose\n\n   \u2022   Essays will allow you to:\n   \u2022   Present your ideas on a subject\n   \u2022   Elaborate on your ideas\n   \u2022   Develop your communication skills\n   \u2022   Write with greater precision\n   \u2022   Develop writing skills that will support you at University and in work-related\n       contexts.\n\nAs you progress through your studies, the standard of expectations on essay writing\nwill rise and may include more complex subjects that will challenge your higher order\nthinking skills e.g., to critically analyse. (Cottrell, 2019)\n\n\n\n3. Structure\n\nThe structure often derives from the genre of writing (English Academic Purpose,\n2021). Generally, if you're asked to write an essay, it should include an introduction,\nwith the main body separated into focused paragraphs, finishing with a conclusion.\nGenerally, organisational features, such as bullet points and subheadings are\nexcluded.\n\n\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                     University of Bolton 2023\n                                               6\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\n4. Preliminaries\n\nTitle page\n\nPurpose\n\nStudents at the University of Bolton are expected to include a title page that contains\nkey information that helps the reader to identify the contents and author of their work.\n\nStructure\n\nGenerally, a title page should include the following information: Programme name\n\nModule title Assessment title Your student number Your marking tutor Date of\nsubmission\n\nAlways check with your Module Tutor to ensure all information has been included.\n\n\n\n5. Introduction\n\nSome experienced academic writers believe writing an introduction can be the\nhardest part and, although it is found at the beginning, it is often easier to complete\nthis part last to make sure all key points are included.\n\nPurpose\n\nIn short, when writing your introduction, it should:\n\n   \u2022   Outline the direction of your assignment and argument\n   \u2022   Provide contextual and background information on the topic\n   \u2022   Explain the overall structure\n\nStructure\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that there is no one way to structure your introduction, but\nmost will include the following parts.\n\n\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                   University of Bolton 2023\n                                            7\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\n Part                               Details\n General Statement                      \u2022   Usually found at the beginning of the\n                                            introduction.\n                                        \u2022   Will help you to introduce the general topic\n                                            and give the reader contextual and\n                                            background information.\n                                        \u2022   If you\u2019re writing a short essay, this may\n                                            include 1 or 2 lines.\n                                        \u2022   For longer essays, you may choose to\n                                            include definitions, outline the main topic\n                                            and separate over 1 or more paragraphs.\n\n\n Thesis Statement                       \u2022   Usually found at the end of the\n                                            introduction.\n                                        \u2022   Will help you to give the reader clear\n                                            information about the content of your\n                                            essay.\n                                        \u2022   Will help you to outline your main ideas on\n                                            the topic and your stance/ argument.\n                                        \u2022   It may also include an outline, as detailed\n                                            below.\n\n Outline                                \u2022   Will help you to explain to the reader how\n                                            your assignment will be structured e.g. in\n                                            chronological order.\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n[General statement] The introduction is an important component of any genre of\nacademic writing. [Thesis statement] The Introduction will help the reader to\nunderstand the direction of the assignment, provide contextual and background\ninformation on the topic and explain the overall structure. [Outline] This essay will\nexamine the purpose and structure of a well-written introduction and conclude that,\nunless the writer achieves this, the reader will find it extremely difficult to understand\nwhat the writing is about.\n\n\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                     University of Bolton 2023\n                                            8\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\n6. Main Body\n\nThe main body, or the main part to your essay, is a collection of paragraphs, all of\nwhich relate the to the topic.\n\nPurpose\n\nTo present, explore and develop your ideas and argument.\n\nStructure\n\nThe main body should be logically sequenced to ensure the reader can follow and\nunderstand your work. The main body of your essay must include well-constructed\nparagraphs. For more information on structuring your paragraphs, see the next\nsection, \u2018Putting it all together\u2019\n\n\n\n7. Conclusion\n\nIn contrast to the introduction, the conclusion should be relatively straightforward. By\nthis point in the writing process, your main ideas and argument should already be set\nout in the main body of your essay. Therefore, all you need to do is summarise your\nessay and add a concluding comment on the topic.\n\nPurpose\n\n   \u2022   To bring all of your main ideas together and set out your overall position\n   \u2022   Highlight gaps or weaknesses and make recommendations for future\n       research\n\n\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                   University of Bolton 2023\n                                           9\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\nStructure\n\n Summarise your essay                 \u2022   Have a clear transitional signal.

Definition\n\nDraws on personal experiences by critically analysing an experience, demonstrating\nhow it affected you, linking back to theory.\n\n\n\n2. Purpose\n\nDuring your time at the University of Bolton, it is most likely you will be required to\nwrite a reflective essay, in which you reflect on academic or work-based placements,\nevaluate an experiment or simply a reflection on literature that links theory to\npractice. However, it can often to prove difficult to write about your feelings and be\ncritical of your actions.\n\nThis piece of work will allow you to reflect on an event and demonstrate to the\naudience what you have learnt from it. It is an opportunity for you to explain what\nhappened, briefly express your feelings and what you have learnt and how you could\ndo things differently next time.\n\nNeedless to say, therefore, this style of writing will not only help you in an academic\ncontext, but develop important skills that will support you in your chosen profession\nonce you commence employment.\n\n\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                     University of Bolton 2023\n                                            11\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\n3.

Choose a Topic\n\nBefore you begin to structure your assignment, you need to choose a topic.\nRemember, although you\u2019re writing about a personal experience, it is still a formal\npiece of academic writing that needs to meet the assignment brief. Therefore, you\nneed to choose a topic that achieves this objective and allows you to write a strong\npiece of work. To help you choose a topic, you may wish to consider the following:\n\n   \u2022   Is the topic relevant? If not, perhaps it\u2019s one to avoid.\n   \u2022   Does the topic relate to theory? If so, you can write about how your\n       experience links back to existing literature.\n   \u2022   Did you learn something? If so, write about what you learnt as long as it links\n       back to the topic.\n   \u2022   Were you inspired? Did the topic inspire you, but you can still write about it\n       critically?\n   \u2022   Can the topic be analysed? For instance, are there different debates around\n       the topic you can write about?\n\n\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                        University of Bolton 2023\n                                            12\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\n5. Structure\n\nYour assignment brief may ask you to consider a certain model of reflection. There\nare various models, all of which help you to reflect but may have different sections.\nFor the purpose of this Tutorial, Gibbs (1988) has been used. Other models include\nDriscoll (1994) that considers \u2018What? So What? Now What?\u2019 whereby, if you use this\nmodel, you will need to structure your assignment slightly differently. As a general\nrule, always check your assignment brief to see whether you have been instructed to\nuse a certain model of reflection.\n\nGibbs (1988) considers six stages of reflection, all of which will help you to structure\nyour assignment. These are:\n\n\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                   University of Bolton 2023\n                                           13\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\n6. Preliminaries\n\nPurpose\n\nStudents at the University of Bolton are expected to include a title page that contains\nkey information that helps the reader to identify the contents and author of their work.\n\nStructure\n\nGenerally, a title page should include the following information:\n\n   \u2022   Programme name\n   \u2022   Module title\n   \u2022   Assessment title\n   \u2022   Your student number\n   \u2022   Your marking tutor\n   \u2022   Date of submission\n\nAlways check with your Module Tutor to ensure all information has been included.\n\n\n\n7. Description\n\nYou might want to comment on the following:\n\n   \u2022   Explain what happened\n   \u2022   Provide background and contextual information on the topic. That might\n       include details on your work-based placement and who you were working with\n       (careful to maintain confidentiality)\n   \u2022   Describe the event but hold short of describing your feelings \u2013 just stick to the\n       facts\n\n\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                   University of Bolton 2023\n                                               14\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\n\n\n8. Feelings\n\n   \u2022   You might want to comment on the following:\n   \u2022   Discuss your feelings and thoughts on the event\n   \u2022   How did it make you feel at the time and afterwards?\n   \u2022   Remember this is your personal reflection, therefore, you can discuss your\n       feelings \u2013 just remember it is a piece of academic writing\n   \u2022   Avoid offensive language\n   \u2022   Maintain confidentiality\n\n\n\n9. Evaluation\n\nYou might want to comment on the following:\n\n   \u2022   Describe how well it went. For instance, how did you and those around you\n       react?\n   \u2022   What was good and bad about the experience?\n   \u2022   Were there any limits, implications or lessons to be learnt? If so, how did\n       these affect you?\n   \u2022   Link back to theory\n\n\n\n10. Analysis\n\nYou might want to comment on the following:\n\n   \u2022   Follows your evaluation\n   \u2022   You might want to comment on why the event took place\n   \u2022   Did anything help or hinder the situation?\n   \u2022   Link back to theory\n\n\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                   University of Bolton 2023\n                                          15\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\n11. Conclusion\n\nYou might want to comment on the following:\n\n   \u2022   What you could have done differently\n   \u2022   If the experience was negative, is there anything you would do to avoid the\n       situation from happening or prevent it from happening again?\n   \u2022   If the experience was positive, would you do the same next time? Are there\n       any long-term effects?\n   \u2022   Link to theories, if necessary\n\n\n\n12. Action Plan\n\nYou might want to comment on the following:\n\n   \u2022   The Action Plan will summarise any action you will need to take for next time\n   \u2022   State what you learnt. Did you take anything away from the experience?\n   \u2022   What is the broader significance? Are there any lessons to be learnt from your\n       experience that affects the profession of your programme, for students or\n       existing theories?\n   \u2022   Do you need to attend additional training to support your learning?\n   \u2022   Do you need to seek advice from your mentor?\n   \u2022   If the situation arises again, will you be in a better position to cope with it?\n\n\n\n13. Be Critical\n\nIt is important to draw on your personal reflection critically, by:\n\n   \u2022   Not being too descriptive e.g., don\u2019t write a story about an event.\n   \u2022   Using your experience as a starting point, but don\u2019t forget to branch out into\n       your reading and include theories\n   \u2022   State whether your experience is common or uncommon?\n   \u2022   You want to be critical but you should maintain confidentiality. For example, if\n       you\u2019re a Trainee Teacher or student Nurse, ensure you delete names of\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                     University of Bolton 2023\n                                            16\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\n       students, patients and/or Trusts, etc. you work at. If you\u2019re unsure, always\n       check with your Module Tutor.\n\n\n\n14. Useful Tips\n\n   \u2022   Be selective \u2013 you can\u2019t include everything\n   \u2022   Avoid irrelevance; use examples which link to wider reading, which are\n       relevant to the assignment brief\n   \u2022   Limit your emotions. If needed, be critical about your experience, but avoid\n       emotional outpourings\n   \u2022   Personal pronouns, such as \u2018I,\u2019 \u2018me\u2019 and \u2018my\u2019 can be used Avoid repetition\n   \u2022   Demonstrate self-awareness and an awareness for others\n\n\n\n15. Additional Matters\n\nYou should also include:\n\n   \u2022   Reference list\n   \u2022   Bibliography\n   \u2022   Appendices\n   \u2022   A word-count (at the end of the assessment, excluding references, figures\n       and appendices)\n\n\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                  University of Bolton 2023\n                                          17\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\nReport Writing\n1. Definition\n\nAccording to EAP (2022) a report presents and analyses information with a clear\nstructure.\n\n\n\n2. Purpose\n\nThis genre of academic writing is usually saved for presenting the results of an\nexperiment or investigation (EAP, 2022).\n\nReports are structured slightly differently to an essay, as it may contain sub-\nheadings, graphs, charts and tables. Let\u2019s take a look at the structure of a report in\ngreater details.\n\n\n\n3. Structure\n\nGenerally, the structure of a report will be similar for all disciplines at the University\nof Bolton. For the purpose of this Tutorial, a typical structure, using the AIMRaD\nformat (Abstract, Introduction, Methodology, Results and Discussion) has been\ndetailed below.\n\nIt is important that you refer to your Module Guide and Tutor to ensure you structure\nand format your report correctly.\n\n\n\n4.

For\ninstance, the quality of data or research.\n\nSynthesis\n\nTo Synthesise in academic writing is about bringing diverse ideas together to arrive\nat a new meaning or idea. In this context, consider the strengths of the different\napproaches to establish whether there is a different way to look at the issue.\n\n\n\n5. Tips\n\nFind the right balance. Ensure you find the right balance when you compare and\ncontrast ideas.\n\nEnsure you compare and contrast equivalent concepts. For instance, you wouldn\u2019t\ncompare an orange with an apple.\n\n\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                   University of Bolton 2023\n                                             26\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\nSynthesising\n1. Definition\n\nSynthesising is a useful academic skill that will help you with analytical writing. To\nSynthesise, it will involve combining ideas from multiple sources in your work. Unlike\nparaphrasing, which focuses on one author (or idea/ academic source), synthesising\nwill draw on a range of academic sources to find ideas that are similar or\ncontradictory to establish a new idea to support your argument.\n\n\n\n2. Purpose\n\nSynthesising will help you to explain ideas from multiple sources or draw together\nparticular themes or traits. It will also help you to develop and strength your\nargument(s), demonstrate you have read widely on the topic and cite and reference\nmultiple sources.\n\n\n\n3. How to Synthesise\n\nStep 1: Read\n\nYou should find and read relevant source material.\n\nStep 2: Note-take\n\nMake notes on all sources you use in your own words.\n\nStep 3: Cite and reference\n\nYou must cite and reference all source material used in your writing.\n\nStep 4: Create a grid\n\nUsing a new Microsoft Word document insert a table (on Word select \u2018insert,\u2019 \u2018table\u2019\nand choose how many grids you would like. If you prefer, you can draw a grid on a\npiece of paper using the same method.\n\n\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                    University of Bolton 2023\n                                           27\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\nStep 5: List your ideas\n\nWithin each grid, make a list of the main ideas from each source.\n\nStep 6: Identify themes and arguments\n\nOnce you have done this, try to identify the common themes and arguments from\neach source. If it helps, use different colours to help you do this.

The student has identified two common themes, being:\n\n   1. Meaningful interactions and activities\n   2.

You will note how \u2018Theorist D\u2019 has a different idea around\n\u2018Meaningful Interactions and activities,\u2019 compared to the other Theorists. These ideas\ncan now be combined into a paragraph to support your argument. Remember to cite\nand reference your work.\n\nThe following paragraph argues the point in-person teaching is important and it\nremains an effective mode of teaching compared to teaching online.\n\n     \"(1) Teaching in-person remains an effective mode of delivery, compared to\n     teaching online. Supporting the argument that in-person teaching is important,\n     (2) Theorist B (2018) and Theorist A (2022) highlight that in a physical\n     environment, students are able to learn together in the same location. The\n     physical environment is a significant factor when teaching in-person as it allows\n     for meaningful interactions between the teacher and their peers (3) (Theorist C,\n     2017; Theorist B, 2018; Theorist A, 2022). However, (4) Theorist D (2022, p.5)\n     argues that, despite the benefits of in-person teaching, learning online provides\n     students with a richer experience as it allows students to develop their digital\n     skills, learn in familiar surroundings, which in turn, will (4) \u2018save time and money\n     travelling to their provision.\u2019 (5) The weight of evidence appears to suggest that\n     a blended a approach to teaching will ensure the needs of all students are met.\n\n     The next section of this assignment will focus on\u2026\"\n\n\n\n   1.

Now, you need to think about how you\u2019re\n                  going to put it together.\n\n\n\n\nLEAP Online                                University of Bolton 2023\n                                      31\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\nPutting it All together\n\n\n\n\nCohesion: A logical progression of your ideas)\nA logical progression of your ideas will ensure that the audience can follow and\nunderstand your writing. Using your assignment plan think about:\n\n   \u2022   The order in which the audience needs to know about that piece of\n       information\n   \u2022   Select the main point and make sure it answers the learning outcome and is\n       relevant to the argument you wish to make. If it doesn\u2019t, revisit your plan and\n       amend accordingly\n   \u2022   Once you\u2019ve sequenced your ideas, discuss the order with a peer to get their\n       thoughts and to make sure they can follow your work.\n\n\n\n\n              See the Academic Cohesion tutorial of this LEAP Online section for\n              more information.\n\n\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                   University of Bolton 2023\n                                          32\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\nParagraphs\nA paragraph, which is made up of a set of sentences, will help you to develop your\nidea and support your overall argument.\n\nParagraphs are an effective way to break up the text into manageable blocks for the\naudience, allowing them to see how your writing develops step-by-step. Some useful\ntechniques you can consider when preparing a paragraph include:\n\n1. Paragraph Introduction\n\nYou can start each paragraph with a topic sentence. For example, you may wish to\noutline the intention of the paragraph and argument. This will help to signal the\npurpose of the paragraph and provide the audience with an easy transition from the\nprevious paragraph.\n\n\n\n2. Paragraph Main Body\n\nThe main body of your paragraph should be used to explain the topic (which was\nintroduced at the beginning). Evidence should be used to support your argument and\nto give your interpretation of research.\n\n\n\n3. Paragraph Conclusion\n\nConclude your paragraph by linking your idea to the overall argument you\u2019re trying to\nmake and transition to the next paragraph.\n\n\n\nYour paragraph can be developed using the following techniques:\n\n\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                  University of Bolton 2023\n                                           33\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\n1. TEEL\n\nThe TEEL strategy is a good way to ensure your writing is well organised and easy\nto follow. TEEL stands for:\n\nTopic Sentence\n\nAs demonstrated above under \u2018Paragraph Introduction\u2019 a Topic Sentence will allow\nyou to outline the main idea of the paragraph.\n\nExplain\n\nThis is an opportunity for you to explain why your main point is important and\nsupports your overall argument.\n\nEvidence\n\nProvide evidence to support your main point. Ensure you cite and reference\nappropriately.\n\nLink\n\nUsually optional, but as demonstrated under \u2018Paragraph Conclusion\u2019 above, it will\nhelp to link your idea to the overall argument. Furthermore, it is also an effective way\nof transitioning to the next paragraph.\n\n\n\n2. Chronological Organisation\n\nHelps to describe a series of events, steps or observations that occur in time. For\nexample, if you were asked to write an essay about the history of education in the\nUK since the beginning of the twentieth century, you would begin with its conception\n(say, 1900    and outline significant events up to present day.\n\n\n\n\n3. Spatial Organisation\n\nHelps the audience to visualise an idea as you want them to see it, evoke the\naudience\u2019s senses and is often used in descriptive essays. For example, if you were\nasked to write an essay describing objects you would find on a hospital ward, you\n\nLEAP Online                                                   University of Bolton 2023\n                                           34\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\nmay choose to describe the items as they appear when observed. This approach will\nhelp you to create a vivid picture for the reader.\n\nWhen should I start a new paragraph?\n\n1. New Idea or Point\n\nYou should start a new paragraph when you begin a new idea or point. If your idea\nextends over several paragraphs, each new point within that idea should have its\nown paragraph.\n\n2. To Demonstrate Contrast\n\nYou can also start a new paragraph if you want to demonstrate a contrast between\ninformation or ideas. Separate paragraphs will help to contrast the different sides of\na debate, different points of an argument, or any other difference.\n\n3. The Audience Needs a Pause\n\nParagraphs also act as a short break for the audience. Adding a \u201cpause\u201d will help the\naudience to follow your argument. It\u2019s a good idea to add a \u201cpause\u201d if your paragraph\nis becoming too lengthy or complex.\n\n\n\n\nTransition Signals\nHelp to signal the relationship between ideas and help the audience to follow your\nargument effectively.\n\n\n           See the Academic Cohesion tutorial of this LEAP Online section for\n           more information.\n\n\n\n\nIn the next section we will explore the value of evidence\n                in your academic writing.\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                  University of Bolton 2023\n                                           35\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\nEvidence\n\n\n\n\nEvidence is an important feature of academic writing that helps to support your\nopinion and argument. Evidence may include:\n\n   \u2022   Data and statistics\n   \u2022   Examples\n   \u2022   Facts\n   \u2022   Citations\n\nUsing evidence will add substance to your work, allows the audience to see you\nhave undertaken thorough research and helps to support your understanding of\ndifferent concepts and theories. Unless evidence is used in your writing, it may be\nconsidered unreliable or bias.\n\nRemember, you must cite and reference sources appropriately. Failure to do this\nmay result in issues with plagiarism and academic misconduct.\n\n\n\n\n           To learn how cite and reference according to your school\u2019s\n           referencing policy see the \u2018Referencing\u2019 section on LEAP Online for\n           more information.\n\n\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                 University of Bolton 2023\n                                          36\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\nLanguage\n\n\n\n\nBe Concise\n   \u2022   Try and limit it to one point, per sentence.\n   \u2022   Try to use succinct sentences where possible to avoid your point becoming\n       lost in long, complex sentences. For example, \"a man by the the name of\n       Alexander Graham Bell invited... \" would become \"Bell invited...\n\n\n\n\nUse Formal Language\nFor formal academic writing assignments, you should avoid:\n\n1. Colloquialisms\n\nAn informal word or expression that is often used in everyday speech. For example,\n\"Donald (2022) ought [ought being the colloquialism] to be more specific regarding...\"\ncan be replaced with \"There is an opportunity for Donald (2022) to be more specific\nregarding...\"\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                 University of Bolton 2023\n                                           37\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\n2. Contractions\n\nThe result of combining two words together, using an apostrophe. For example, the\nphrase, \u2018This isn\u2019t the case\u2019 should be presented as \u2018this is not the case.\u2019\n\n\n\n3. Clich\u00e9s\n\nHave a general meaning or overused and no longer has a meaning. For example,\nthe phrase, \u2018read between the lines,\u2019 can be replaced with, \u2018implicitly.\u2019\n\n\n\n\nAbbreviation\nUse abbreviations where the phrase is likely to appear frequently in your paper. For\nexample, the Department for Education could be abbreviated to         DfE      . When you\nfirst use a phrase that you wish to abbreviate, make sure you use the full phrase and\nshow the abbreviation in the parentheses immediately after.

Academic writing provides you with an opportunity to discuss your\nthoughts, opinion and understanding on the topic.\n\n\n\n\nLanguage Functions\nThe use of different language functions will help your voice emerge from the writing,\nespecially through discussion points, interpretation of research and evaluation of\nacademic resources.

So, don\u2019t be afraid to\nbe critical! Give your opinion but make sure it\u2019s supported with evidence.\n\n\n\n\n           Useful tip\n\n           Your argument should be detailed throughout your writing. Keep\n           referring to your plan because this will help you to keep focused as\n           you write your assignment. See the 'Critical Thinking' section on\n           LEAP Online for more information.\n\n\n\n\nBe Precise\nUse clear and precise language. You may need to use specialist words in your\nwriting but define this vocabulary if it is not commonly used, or you need to\ndemonstrate understanding to the audience. Here are some useful tips:\n\n   \u2022   Try to pre-empt some of the questions the reader may ask when they read\n       your work. Below is a table of general language, with some questions and\n       synonyms, which will help you become more precise with your writing\n   \u2022   Always link the argument back to the learning outcomes\n\n\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                  University of Bolton 2023\n                                          42\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\n General           Specific\n\n      Big          Can you give a number, size or percentage?

Present both sides of the argument and demonstrate\nthe strengths and weaknesses of these claims. This can be achieved by using\ntechniques, such as hedges, boosters and reporting verbs.\n\n\n\n\n             See 'Paraphrasing' and 'Other Writing Skills' tutorials of this LEAP\n             Online section for more information.\n\n\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                    University of Bolton 2023\n                                            43\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\nObjective\nThe active voice is used to describe the action, using possessive adjectives and\nsubject pronouns, such as: \u2018my,\u2019 \u2018our,\u2019 \u2018I\u2019 and \u2018we.\u2019\n\nHowever, in your academic writing, emphasis should be placed on your writing,\nrather than you. Therefore, using a passive voice will help you to avoid writing as the\nfirst-person.\n\nUnless you are instructed otherwise, an impersonal approach, also commonly\nreferred to as the third-person view, should be used in your writing.\n\n\n\n                                           Pause and Reflect\n\n                                           Let's look at an example:\n\n                                           The sentence below has been written in an\n                                           active voice, consider how this could be\n                                           rewritten in a passive voice.\n\n                                           \"In this essay, I aim to examine theories on\n                                           academic writing.\"\n\n                                           When you're ready, see our solution below.\n\n\n\nOur solution\n\n\"Academic writing theories will be examined in this essay.\"\n\n\n\nWhen you compare the passive example to the active example, you will notice how:\nThe sentence structure has changed, the word 'I' has been removed and the word\n'examine' has been changed to 'examined'. Don't worry too much about this for now\nas the Paraphrasing tutorial will provide more information on sentence structure and\nhow to change the active and passive voice.\n\n\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                     University of Bolton 2023\n                                            44\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\n\nThis section has considered the definition of academic writing and the 6 key features\nof writing success, being:\n\n   \u2022   Clear Focus and Planning\n   \u2022   Audience\n   \u2022   Genres and Writing Styles\n   \u2022   Evidence\n   \u2022   Language\n   \u2022   Voice\n\n\n\n\nWhere to go to next\nBefore you leave, select the button below to complete a short assessment and earn\nyour LEAP Online digital badge.\n\nOnce you have completed the assessment, close the tab, return to the 'Academic\nWriting - Level 2' LEAP Online section and begin the next tutorial.\n\n\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                  University of Bolton 2023\n                                          45\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\nDigital Bage\nBefore you leave, select the button below to complete a short assessment and earn\nyour LEAP Online digital badge.\n\nAcademic Writing: An Introduction to Academic Writing?\n\nMoodle assessment\n\n\n\n\n          For more support on this topic, consider attending a free workshop at\n          LEAP Live.\n\n\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                University of Bolton 2023\n                                        46\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\nReference List\nAlexander, O., Argent, S. and Spencer, J.
