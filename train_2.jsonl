{"content": "The Bolton Award\nWhen considering your own employability, a crucial thing to be aware of is the\ndifference between hard skills and soft skills.\nHard skills are the skills you will learn while completing your course. These are\npractical skills such as coding, accounting or artwork. The skills you are assessed on\nfor your degree and are required to do the job you aspire to.\nSoft skills are broader skills that apply to anyone in a working environment, like:\nteamwork, time management and resilience. These skills affect how you navigate a\nworkplace, how you handle difficult situations and generally make you a more\nrounded and employable individual.\nIn 2019, LinkedIn surveyed over 5,000 talent professionals in 35 countries, all to\nbring people insights into current market trends and how to make yourself more\nemployable.\n91% of the companies surveyed (including Starbucks, Cisco and Sodexo) said that\nsoft skills were among the most important for an applicant to have (LinkedIn Report:\nGlobal talent trends, 2019, LinkedIn Report: These 4 Ideas Are Shaping the Future\nof HR and Hiring)\nThe same survey found that 92% of companies surveyed said soft skills were as\nimportant or more so than hard skills gained in university degrees (LinkedIn Report:\nGlobal talent trends, 2019, LinkedIn Report: These 4 Ideas Are Shaping the Future\nof HR and Hiring)\nThe Bolton Award has been designed to help you to improve these soft skills, as well\nas increasing your industry awareness.

Paper-based application forms are rarely used now.\nSome employers may ask for additional documentation to be sent with your application, such\nas a letter of application or CV, which will need to be attached/uploaded on to the website.\n\nHow to approach an application\n\uf0b7\n\nPrepare intensively as you would for a job interview\n\n\uf0b7\n\nPoor quality applications are surprisingly common\n\nSome employer comments:\n\uf0b7\n\nMayer Brown \u2013 \u201clast year I received more than 1,500 applications, more than 20% had\nthe firm's name misspelt. Another 30% contained typos.\u201d\n\n\uf0b7\n\nAsda \u2013 \u201cdespite receiving 4,000 applications online, many were of poor quality.\u201d\n\nLEAP Online\n\nUniversity of Bolton\n\n\fWhat do employers look for?\n\uf0b7\n\nApplications targeted to the organisation and role\n\n\uf0b7\n\nCorrect grammar and spelling\n\n\uf0b7\n\nComplete and concise information\n\nPreparation\n\uf0b7\n\nGet hold of a Job Description which describes the job and principle duties and a\nPerson Specification which describes the essential and desirable skills and\nexperience necessary to fulfil the requirements of the position.\n\n\uf0b7\n\nResearch the organisation by looking through their website and any other information\nthat you may have about them.\n\nDifferent formats of application forms\nAll application forms ask for standardised content such as personal details, education and\nemployment history. It is important to give full details starting with your most recent\neducation, work and experience. They also ask for references which would usually be an\nemployer and a university lecturer.\n\nThere may also be an equal opportunities monitoring form which is removed from the\napplication before short-listing. This helps employers monitor and improve standards of\nrecruitment and employment practice.\n\nIn addition to the standardised information, employers may also require a supporting\nstatement. This is probably the most important part of the application form as it provides you\nwith the opportunity to show how you meet the job requirements. This section can vary\ndepending upon the employer, but some of the more typical examples include the following:\nSupporting statement (Skills, Knowledge and Experience)\nThe majority of applications ask you to complete a supporting statement. This is where you\nneed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge and experience for the role. It is important that\nyou address the points in the Person Specification in the order in which they appear, as\nthis will be used as a checklist for short-listing by the employer. Each one should be tailored\nto the job you are applying for. Address each point on the person specification in a clearly\nthemed paragraph.\n\nLEAP Online\n\nUniversity of Bolton\n\n\fCompetency based application forms\nSome employers ask competency-based questions which match the Person Specification, in\norder to see if you possess the skills that will make you succeed in the role.\nSTAR Technique: When preparing answers to competency-based questions it may be helpful\nto use the STAR technique. This is a simple approach based on providing the following\ninformation:\n\uf0b7\n\nSituation or context of the particular example you are providing\n\n\uf0b7\n\nTask \u2013 what you had to do to achieve the desired result\n\n\uf0b7\n\nAction \u2013 what you actually did. The important word here is YOU. They want to know\nabout your contribution\n\n\uf0b7\n\nResult \u2013 what was the outcome?\n\nRemember to use recent examples, and if you're asked several competency-based\nquestions within an application use different examples for each one.\nStrength based application forms\nThese questions usually take a great deal of thought and are designed to find your natural\naptitude and motivations. Some examples include:\n\uf0b7\n\nDescribe something you are particularly proud of?\n\n\uf0b7\n\nTell us about a task that comes easily to you?\n\n\uf0b7\n\nHighlight the reasons why should we meet with you over other candidates?\n\nApplication forms which ask for a personal statement e.g. UCAS forms\nMost teaching/academic applications will ask for a Personal Statement which should explain\nwhy you are applying. It is important to include a structure which is clear, concise and easy\nfor the person who is shortlisting to understand.\n\nOne possible structure is:\nWhy? Personal experiences which have led to making this decision\nWhat do you bring to the course/job? Academic and extra-curricular experience\nWhere are you heading? Ambition and career plans\n\nLEAP Online\n\nUniversity of Bolton\n\n\fApplication checklist\nBefore you press \u2018send\u2019 carry out these final checks:\n\u2022\n\nDO tailor your application to the organisation and role\n\n\u2022\n\nDO make sure you are using the right form - some employers have different forms for\ndifferent job functions\n\n\u2022\n\nDO read the form through and follow all instructions\n\n\u2022\n\nDO keep a copy of your answers.

{"content": "Careers and Professional Skills\nCareers and professional skills as a term, is often used as \u2018short-hand\u2019 to describe a\nset of employability skills, attitudes and attributes that a person may have or develop\nin order to secure a job:\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\nSkill = a type of work/activity which requires specialist training and knowledge\nAttitude = a way of thinking, feeling or behaving which reflects a state of mind\nand contributes to a person\u2019s personality\nAttribute = an inherent quality or strength\n\nDefinitions of Employability\nEmployability focuses on enhancing the academic, personal and professional\ndevelopment of learners to meet the changing needs of employers, the economy and\nsociety. Over the last 20 years, definitions of employability have shifted towards a\nmore holistic view of \u2018graduate attributes\u2019 that include transferable skills and personcentred qualities, developed in conjunction with subject specific knowledge, skills\nand competencies.\n\u201cBeing able to get a job, keep a job, and if necessary find another job.\u201d\nCarl Gilleard - Association of Graduate Recruiters\n\nDeveloping Careers and Professional Skills, Attitudes and Attributes\nThrough Academic Study\nYour university experience has value in several contexts beyond just your course.\nConsider aspects of your time at university such as your subject specific knowledge,\nany membership of academic societies and/or professional bodies, discussions of\nprofessional ethical values and relevant legislation. Tutors also help you identify\nwhat employability skills, attitudes and attributes you develop through the use of\nLearning Objectives.\nTo help you construct a Personal Development Plan (PDP), you should actively\nreflect, review and take part in career planning activities. A useful strategy is to\nrecord your skills and achievements as you go along. You will then have a rich bank\nof evidence to withdraw from to use for applications and interviews.\n\nLEAP Online\n\nUniversity of Bolton 2020\n\n\fTransferable Skills\nUsually picked up over a period of time, transferable skills are developed in one\nsituation and can be transferred to another situation. They can be gained from\nprevious job positions, charity or voluntary work and even your hobbies and can be\napplied to a range of jobs and industries. Not only do they show that you\u2019d be a good\nfit for the team, they can also demonstrate what a candidate can bring to a role, and\nhow much they\u2019ve learnt from previous positions or experiences. They also enable\nyou to apply for work and training beyond your subject specialism if necessary.\nThere are so many skills that could be classed as transferable, and every individual\nwill have their own \u2018set\u2019, with natural ability and aptitude towards certain skills. All\nemployers will be looking for something different, but some of the more common\nones that are often cited by employers include: communication, team work,\nnumeracy, organisation, time management, problem solving, flexibility, initiative,\ncommercial awareness, leadership and the use of ICT.\n\nExperience of Work\nReal work experience is essential for you to develop your skills and you can also\ncheck out a potential industry that you are interested in. You should consider the\nskills you are interested in developing further and then choose an appropriate\ncontext from which to gain that experience.\nWork experience is really important, even if you are employed in a shop or working\nin a bar, there are transferable skills that you can draw upon such as customer\nservice, communication skills, numeracy, time management, flexibility etc. If you do\nnot have any work experience yet, it is highly recommended that you gain some\nwhilst at university to increase your employability skills.\n\nThrough Extra Curricular Activities\nDuring the application process it is important that you articulate all the skills you have\ngained, and not just those from work or study. You may have been involved in a\nstudent society or club, or held a position of responsibility within the University such\nas a Student Representative or Student Ambassador. Even at the University of\nBolton, you can undertake paid and voluntary opportunities to enhance you\nemployability skills.\n\nLEAP Online\n\nUniversity of Bolton 2020\n\n\fVoluntary Work\nMany students acquire a range of transferable skills from undertaking voluntary\nwork. Evidence of voluntary work is increasingly cited as being important to\nemployers (The Brathay Trust, Guardian Careers, 2014). Consider choosing an\nopportunity that has meaning to you in order to engage fully with the experience.\n\nUnderstanding your Individual Attitudes and Attributes\nTwo fifths of bosses surveyed by The Brathay Trust, (Guardian Careers 2014)\nsuggested as well as wanting to know about graduates skills they also wanted to\ngain an understanding of the personal qualities and strengths of graduates. It\nrevealed that a strong work ethic, commitment, resilience and motivation are the\ntraits recruiting managers look out for most. It is important that individuals\nunderstand their own individual strengths and attitudes\n\nNetworking and Social Media\nUniversity follow-up of graduates via the annual, national Destination of Leavers from\nHigher Education (DLHE) Survey, evidences a strong trend in the importance of\nnetworking skills and \u2018mining\u2019 personal and professional contacts to source\nemployment. The effective use of social media has become more important and\nincreasingly used by employers for recruitment purposes. It is now viewed as\nessential to have a LinkedIn profile and to be actively using LinkedIn. It is also a\nuseful way of finding employment opportunities and gaining commercial awareness.\n\nSo can I enhance my careers and professional skills at the University of\nBolton?\nYes! Look at our Graduate Attributes Matrix for Employability (GAME)\nIn 2017, the University of Bolton developed the Graduate Attributes Matrix for\nEmployability (GAME). This matrix aims to evidence the development potential that a\nstudent can have within the Bolton learning environment.\nThe Graduate attributes are:\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\nExpressive of what it means to be a University of Bolton graduate\nNot simply taught in the classroom but fostered through meaningful\nexperiences and as a result of continuous learning and reflection\nUnique to every student \u2013 in terms of their starting point, experiences,\ndevelopment and comprehension\n\nLEAP Online\n\nUniversity of Bolton 2020\n\n\fThe Graduate attributes, as highlighted below, are the personal qualities, skills and\nacademic abilities that the University of Bolton community values, and that a student\nshould acquire during their time at this university. Graduate attributes can be\ndeveloped as part of a programme of study, as well as through the wider student\nexperience. The Graduate Attributes Framework has been created to allow for\npersonalisation by each School and subject area and tailoring for particular co- and\nextra-curricular activities.\n\nIn conclusion, the term \u2018employability\u2019 can be seen as a shorthand expression of a\nrange of complex skills, attitudes and attributes whose component parts are:\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\nYour subject specialism skills and knowledge\nGeneric transferable skills which where adapted, can be applied in different\nwork contexts\nA range of \u2018soft\u2019 attitudes and attributes identified as important to employers\nWork experience or employment\nCareer management and planning skills\n\nContact us: 01204 903080, https://studenthub.bolton.ac.uk\nAccess LEAP Online at: www.bolton.ac.uk/leaponline\n\nLEAP Online\n\nUniversity of Bolton 2020\n\n\f", "metadata": {"source": "/Users/mac/Documents/Chatbot/Testdata/Careers-and-Professional-Skills.txt"}}
{"content": "Interviews\nTo be shortlisted for an interview means that you have successfully completed an\napplication form or produced an effective CV which has enabled you to stand out\nfrom the crowd, and meet the job criteria as specified by the employer. The employer\nmust be impressed enough to want to find out more about you and to take your\napplication to the next stage of the selection process.\nBeing interviewed for a job can sometimes feel daunting, however thorough planning\nand preparation can give you the confidence to help you to be successful.\nThe interview is a two way interaction. The employer wants to see if you are the right\ncandidate for the role but, equally, it is also your chance to see if you would be\nhappy to work for them. The interview process isn\u2019t about trying to trip you up or\ncatch you out, it is about finding out what you are good at. It is an opportunity for you\nto breathe life into your application form or CV.\n\nTypes of Interview\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\nOne to one interview\nPanel Interview\nGroup Interview\nCase Study Interview\nSkype Interview\nVideo Interview\nSequential interview\nTelephone Interview\nAssessment Centre Interview\n\nPreparation for an Interview\nYou should consider the following steps in readiness for your interview:\nResearch the employer: read any literature there is about the employer. Do not go in\n\u2018cold\u2019. Always look at basic information such as company size, locations, products\nand services offered, turnover, organisational structures and competitors. Find out if\nthe company has been in the news recently and why. Check out the company /\norganisations\u2019 website, broadsheet newspapers, relevant professional journals and\n\nLEAP Online\n\nUniversity of Bolton 2020\n\n\fprofessional bodies. Then you should look for more detail about the position and\ndepartment you are seeking to join.\nResearch the job sector: commercial awareness is extremely important so before\nyou go for your interview look at developments within that particular sector i.e.\nfinancial downturns, changes to legislation etc. Try and think about how this could\naffect their organisation and impact on the role for which you are applying.\nUnderstand the role you are applying for: this may seem like an obvious point, but\nfeedback from many employers would suggest that candidates don\u2019t always prepare\nenough and sometimes don\u2019t even seem to know what job they have applied for!\nRead over the job descriptions and specification. If possible, try and speak to the\nperson who is currently doing the job, or someone in the same department.\nRe-visit your application form: when applying for a job always remember to keep a\ncopy of your application form. Read this again before you attend your interview, as\nthe organisation may pick up on information that you have given. Think again about\nwhy you want the job and how your skills, knowledge and experience match against\nthe requirements of the role.\nPrepare answers: try and anticipate what you think the questions will be; you can do\nthis by looking at the job specification. Try and practice beforehand by arranging a\nmock interview with a Careers Adviser.\nPrepare some questions to ask: always prepare some questions that you can ask\nthe employer at the interview. Time is usually allocated for this at the end of the\nformal questions, but this will be made clear to you on the day. Asking questions\ncreates a favourable impression and will enable you to understand more about the\nrole.\nBe sure to know why you find the job interesting: most employers will ask you why\nyou are interested in working for them. Be sure to have a genuine and well\nresearched answer planned.\n\nPractical Preparation\nPlan your journey: always make sure you know where you are going. Work out your\njourney time and always try to arrive 15 minutes early. If possible, drive to your\ndestination a few days before your interview to familiarise yourself with the journey\nand the route, and always try to allow for traffic and unscheduled delays. Print off a\nmap if needed. It is also a good idea to take a contact name and number with you in\ncase you are delayed for any reason.\nCheck out exactly where your interview will be held, the building, floor, room number\netc. Multiple businesses may be located in one building or across different sites.\n\nLEAP Online\n\nUniversity of Bolton 2020\n\n\fDress appropriately: make sure you have a smart outfit that is clean, as an interview\nis a formal occasion. Do not wear jewellery or accessories that are too distracting.\nUse common sense where piercings and tattoos are concerned. If you are unable to\nremove them, try and ensure studs remain small and any offensive body art is\ncovered.\nWhat to take with you: it may be a good idea to take a copy of your CV and\napplication form as a reference/guide; also any relevant portfolios (particularly if you\nare applying for a role within the creative industries) and your certificates. It is\nacceptable to write questions down that you would like to ask and take them in with\nyou. Whatever you do take into the interview room, make sure it is presented in a\nprofessional wallet or document folder.\nIf you have a disability: you will need to address the issue of disclosing your disability\nto the employer before the interview.\n\nThe Interview\nControlling your Nerves\nEveryone feels a little nervous before an interview. In order to remain calm, the best\nadvice is to prepare as much as you can before the day. Mock interviews can be\narranged with a Careers Adviser in advance, which will help you to familiarise\nyourself with the process. This is also a good way of gaining feedback on your\noverall performance. Try and ensure you get a good night\u2019s sleep, set your alarm\nand make sure you leave yourself plenty of time to get to the interview. All\ninterviewers are aware of how nerve-wracking an interview can be, so they should\ntry to put you at ease.\nOn entering the interview room shake hands with the interviewer if appropriate and,\nwhen invited to do so, take a seat. Try to sit up straight and avoid slouching. Speak\nclearly and calmly. It is natural to feel nervous before an interview but you need to\nshow that you can manage any anxiety. If an employer is looking for someone who\ncan cope with pressure then the interview is a good guide for them.\n\nBody Language\nBody language is extremely important in an interview situation. The way you enter\nthe room, your handshake, the way you sit, all give signals about your confidence,\nyour interest and your manners. Although you will not be marked against this\ncriterion it will be duly noted by the employer. Smiling is essential, and helps to strike\nup and maintain rapport with the interviewers. Try not to wave your hands around too\nmuch.\n\nLEAP Online\n\nUniversity of Bolton 2020\n\n\fMaintain eye contact. Looking down or away from the interviewer can make you\nappear disinterested or insincere. With panel interviews, the best advice is to look at\nand answer the person asking the question, with a glance from time to time at the\nother interviewers to include them in your reply.\n\nInterview Questions\nBy now you should have undertaken your research in preparation for your interview\nand will hopefully have a very good idea about the technical knowledge, experience\nand skills required for the role. The questions you will be asked will be based around\nthese criterion.\nEmployers ask questions that are traditionally designed to help them understand you\nas a person: to gauge your motivation levels, your experience, your skills and certain\naspects of your personality that may have an impact on your overall performance.\nThey will have already been provided with a synopsis of this information from your\nCV or application form, so they are looking to clarify information within the interview\nprocess.\nThe following information describes the types of questions you are likely to get asked\nin a graduate interview:\n\nWarm Up Questions\nThese are asked at the beginning of the interview and are designed to put you at\nease. Common warm up questions are \u2018Tell me about yourself?\u2019 or \u2018Why have you\napplied for the position?\u2019 Keep your answers short and succinct aligning your\nexperience to the role and highlighting your interest in the position/organisation. The\ninterviewer can tell a lot about your personality from the way you respond.\n\nCompetency-Based Questions\nCompetency based questions provide employers with an idea of how you might\nperform in the workplace by asking questions that test how you have reacted to and\ndealt with previous academic, work or social situations. The questions will be\nfocused upon your skills and will relate to the person specification of the job. You will\nbe asked to give an example of a situation or task which led you to take a certain\ncourse of action. Probing questions will then be used by the interviewer to determine\nthe course of action you took, what changes were created by those actions, and the\neffects of those actions on you and/or others.\n\nLEAP Online\n\nUniversity of Bolton 2020\n\n\fWhen preparing for this type of questioning remember the STAR approach:\nSituation \u2013 describe the situation that relates to the question being asked.\nTask \u2013 what tasks did you identify that needed to be completed?\nAction \u2013 what action did you take?\nResult \u2013 How did you know that your actions where successful?\n\nEnsure you choose examples that are as relevant to the role as possible, that were\nchallenging and really show off your skills. Avoid saying \u2018we\u2019 to describe actions\ntaken in a team, as the employer is not recruiting the team but needs to be clear\nwhat \u2018you\u2019 specifically contributed.\n\nYour Questions to the Interviewer\nIt is normal for an interviewer to ask you if you have any questions at the end of an\ninterview. Preparing some questions to ask the employer is a good way to show that\nyou are keen and enthusiastic about working for the company. If you don\u2019t ask any\nquestions some recruiters may interpret this as disinterest. It is advisable to ask\nbetween 1-3 questions at the end of the interview. If the interview panel have already\ncovered the information as part of the process, let them know that all of your\nquestions have been answered adequately.\n\nOnline Interviews\nMore and more employers are moving their interviews online as a result of the recent\npandemic. You should prepare for an online interview in a similar way to a face-toface interview.\n\uf0b7\n\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\nDon\u2019t forget to check the meeting link details that will be provided for you to\nconnect on the day \u2013 Zoom? Microsoft Teams? Skype? \u2013 have you got the\nright application downloaded in advance? Is your microphone working?\nYou must still dress smartly to help create the right impression\nEnsure that you are in a space that is free from distractions and noise, and\nensure your background on the screen is appropriate\n\nLEAP Online\n\nUniversity of Bolton 2020\n\n\fFINALLY\u2026\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\nResearch the organisation, the job and the sector\nUnderstand your strengths, skills and abilities and target them to the position\nBelieve in yourself and be confident\nPrepare your answers in advance\nPrepare some questions to ask them\nBook a mock interview with a Careers Adviser to practice beforehand\nPlan what you are going to wear\nPlan your journey\n\nResources to help you with preparing for interviews\nFor further help with interview preparation check out our resources on SudentHub+.\nYou can access our Interview360 tool and Graduates First AI Interview Simulator\nhttps://studenthub.bolton.ac.uk\n\nAccess LEAP Online at: www.bolton.ac.uk/leaponline\n\nLEAP Online\n\nUniversity of Bolton 2020\n\n\f", "metadata": {"source": "/Users/mac/Documents/Chatbot/Testdata/Interviews.txt"}}

If\nyou are interested please contact us to speak with an advisor for information on this\nand to fill in the referral forms.\nWhat support can you get from Disability service?\nThis will depend very much upon the disability or condition being supported and the\nindividual needs of the student so comparing with other students might not\nnecessarily be helpful.\nWe would need a copy of your medical evidence. If you have a medical condition or\nmental health condition we can help with supplying a medical evidence form that you\ncan ask your doctor to complete for you. When we have appropriate evidence we\ncan start looking into putting in place appropriate support for you.\nIf you are eligible we would encourage you to apply to your funding body such as\nStudent Finance England for Disabled Students\u2019 Allowance. Through this you would\nbe likely to have an assessment of need. An assessment of need is a chat with an\nexperienced disability assessor who can find out how your condition affects you and\nask your funding body to pay for cost of support they think is appropriate to\nrecommend for you.\nPossible support though disabled students allowance can include support workers\nsuch as study skills tutor, mental health mentor or British sign language interpreter.\nAssistive technology solutions may be recommended too, for example audio read\n\nLEAP Online\n\nUniversity of Bolton 2020\n\n\fback or speech recognition software and magnifying software or support with\nrecording lectures. Recommendations are tailored to the Individual needs of the\nstudent.\nThe disability team can also send a notification to your academic department giving\nadvice on appropriate inclusive teaching strategies. We can make arrangements for\nalternative adjustments for examinations as appropriate such as extra time. We have\nmarking guidelines for SpLDs and can provide stickers to identify your work for\ntutors, extended library loans and accessible parking for blue badge holders.\nHelp and Support\nIf you feel you have a disability, specific learning difficulty or health condition that\nmay come under disability support please get in touch for further advice.

{"content": "Graduate Attributes Matrix for Employability (GAME)\nThe University of Bolton has developed the Graduate Attributes Matrix for\nEmployability (GAME), which provides an overview of the key skills it expects all\ngraduates to leave University with.\nGAME is used by the Careers Team to help you self-assess where you are in terms\nof employability skills and attributes. This model should be used to assess your\nprofessional development during your time at university and provide you with a\nfoundation for the start of your career.\nThe Graduate attributes are:\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\nSymbolic of what it means to be a University of Bolton graduate\nNot simply taught in the classroom but fostered through meaningful\nexperiences and as a result of continuous learning and reflection\nUnique to every student \u2013 in terms of their starting point, experiences,\ndevelopment and comprehension\n\nThe GAME model comprises 10 attributes:\n1. Self-aware\nTo have a clear perception of your personality, strengths, weaknesses, thoughts,\nbeliefs, motivations and emotions, and how these can affect your subsequent\ndecisions and behaviours through self-reflection.\n2. Resilient\nTo utilise effective coping strategies to withstand, learn from or recover quickly from\ndifficult, stressful and challenging situations.\n3. Problem solver\nTo use a range of techniques and consider a number of options in a systematic\nmanner, to find positive solutions to challenging problems posed.\n4. Effective Communicator\nTo actively listen, share information, provide direction and express ideas and\nfeelings effectively through a range of different forms (verbally, visually and written)\nso that the intended message is successfully delivered, received, understood and\nresponded to.\n\nLEAP Online\n\nUniversity of Bolton 2022\n\n\f5. Global Citizen\nTo understand, respect and embrace diversity, different cultures and different ways\nof working, and to recognise the global issues that affect us.\n6. Enterprising\nTo demonstrate, creativity, innovation, initiative and resourcefulness, and be ready to\nact as opportunities present themselves.\n7. Adaptable\nTo be flexible and responsive to change in any given situation or work environment,\nor in response to the needs, wishes or demands of others.\n8. Collaborative\nTo develop a purposeful relationship/team with two or more people to constructively\nexplore ideas and achieve shared goals.\n9. Confident\nTo be able to demonstrate a firm belief in yourself and your abilities.\n10. Lifelong Learner\nTo evaluate personal performance and independently seek and act upon means of\nimprovement to allow for the advancement of skills and knowledge for personal or\nprofessional reasons.\n\nEvidencing your skills\nConsider your USP (unique selling point). What are your unique strengths, skills,\nattributes, attitudes and experiences which will help to distinguish you in the job\nmarket? Do you have good, relevant examples for each GAME attribute?\nRather than viewing this as a tick list you will address on one occasion you should\nmake an assessment of where you are at this point in time, set your goals and\ndetermine what needs to be done in order to get that dream job. You can find tools\non Studenthub that explain each attribute in detail and allow you to decide how you\nhave demonstrated this.\nBy developing an action plan now to address GAME, you will significantly increase\nyour employability skills which will help you to enter your chosen profession.\n\nLEAP Online\n\nUniversity of Bolton 2022\n\n\fSo how do employers know I have these skills?\nMany employers will assess applicants against a range of criteria. There may be a\njob specification which will make this explicit. If not, you will need to identify the\ncompetencies the employer requires through the advert, job description and your\nresearch into the company.\nIn order to prove that you possess these skills you will need to provide evidence to\nsupport your claim: it is not enough to say that you can do something \u2013 you have to\nprove it. Show not tell!\nThis is where all the work experience you have undertaken reaps its reward. Think\nabout:\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\nThe part time work you have taken on\nThe voluntary work you signed up for\nElements of your academic studies.\n\nAll need to be carefully considered.\n\nEvidencing GAME in the recruitment process\nOnce you have developed your action plan and looked at your examples for each it\nis a good idea to include these examples during the recruitment process.\nOne of the best ways to do this is by using the STAR technique. This allows you to\nthink about a Situation, the Task you had to perform and then the Actions you took\n(be careful to highlight your role rather than that of the group) and finally but\nimportantly the Result, where it would be useful if you could give a quantifiable\nexample using numbers (maybe a mark for an assignment) or some qualitative\nfeedback from a line manager.\nSTAR is detailed within the Application Forms LEAP Online section but it is an\nexcellent way to demonstrate your graduate attributes throughout the recruitment\nprocess.\nSTAR is especially useful on applications and when answering competency-based\ninterview questions such as:\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\nTell us about a time you have been an effective team member (Collaborative)\nHow did you manage a situation when something did not go to plan?\n(Problem solver)\nTell us about a time when you have been innovative (Creativity)\nWhen and how have you communicated a message effectively? (Effective\nCommunicator)\n\nLEAP Online\n\nUniversity of Bolton 2022\n\n\fHopefully you are now fully familiar with the 10 attributes that employers look for and\nyou can articulate these in the recruitment process.\nIf you really want to make sure you can demonstrate these attributes, we have a\nrange of tools on Studenthub such as the GAME self-assessment action plan and\nCV and Interview 360, which will allow you to put your new found knowledge into\npractice (https://studenthub.bolton.ac.uk).\nYou can book an appointment with the Careers and Employability Service via\nStudenthub.

However, it is a core skill that\nstudents at the University of Bolton need to learn, since it forms part of academic\nassessment.\n\nAs outlined in the General Assessment Guidelines, which will be examined shortly,\nas you advance through your course at the University, there is an expectation that\nyour \u2018Written English\u2019 will continue to improve. Specifically, there is a strong\nemphasis on your writing style, spelling, punctuation and grammar and other\nacademic conventions.\n\nFurthermore, depending on the task, you will be expected to adapt your writing style.\nFor example, University of Bolton assessments incorporate different writing styles,\nwhereby you may be asked to flip between personal reflections to a critical analysis.\nTherefore, it is important that you have the underpinning knowledge to help you\nmove between the different writing styles and achieve the higher-grades.\n\nIf all of this sounds slightly alien to you right now, please do not worry. This Tutorial\naims to introduce you to academic writing with a definition and the main\ncharacteristics and steps you can take to start developing your academic writing\nskills.\n\n\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                      University of Bolton 2023\n                                             1\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\nWhat is Academic Writing?\n                                           Pause and Reflect\n\n                                           Think about what the following words have\n                                           in common.\n\n                                                \u2022   Journal Article\n                                                \u2022   Narrative/story\n                                                \u2022   Poem\n                                                \u2022   Letter\n                                                \u2022   Diary entry\n                                                \u2022   Research projects\n                                                \u2022   Reflective writing\n\nThey are all different types of writing!\n\nAs demonstrated by the above list, we write for a variety of reasons. Therefore, it\u2019s\nimportant that we adjust our writing to ensure it is suitable for the audience.\nAcademic writing is no different.\n\nThe term \u2018academic writing\u2019 can be defined as writing that will allow you to\ncommunicate your ideas and opinion, information and research to the academic\ncommunity at the University and beyond (English Academic Purpose, 2021).\n\nAt the University of Bolton, students are largely assessed on their ability to write,\ntherefore, academic writing skills are a fundamental component of academic\nsuccess.\n\nTo demonstrate learning throughout your studies, you may be required to produce\ndifferent types of writing, for example: essays, reports, dissertations, action research\nprojects, blogs, vlogs, etc. While each programme has specific writing conventions\nand types of discourse, there are some general characteristics of scholarly work.\n\n\n\n\n     Let\u2019s look at these characteristics in greater detail.\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                       University of Bolton 2023\n                                            2\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\nClear Focus and Planning\n\n\n\n\nFirstly, effective academic writing can be characterised by the clear focus to define\nthe purpose of your writing. In other words, you are required to write for a specific\npurpose.\n\nTo achieve this aim, you will need to carry out in-depth research into the topic area,\nfrom which you can plan your assignment accordingly.\n\nThe Module Guide, which you will receive at the beginning of a new module, will help\nyou to prepare and answer the learning outcomes set for you.\n\nAs you will note from the Module Guide, formal academic writing tasks at the\nUniversity are set by, and written for, academic staff or assessors, and there is clear\ncriteria against which your work will be marked. The General Assessment\nGuidelines, which can be found within the Module Guide, set out the marking criteria\nfor your level of study.\n\n\n\n\n   The next section of the Academic Writing tutorial will\n   provide useful tips to help you plan your assignment.\n\n\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                   University of Bolton 2023\n                                           3\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\nConsider the Audience\n\n\n\n\nThe reader of your assignment is also known as the \u2018audience.\u2019 We communicate\ndifferently with different people we meet.\n\nWhen you\u2019re writing, try to imagine you\u2019re writing for a larger audience, who might:\n\n   \u2022   Not have the same level of subject knowledge as your Module Tutor.\n   \u2022   Not have the same level of experience as you.\n\nBy having these points and the audience in mind, will help you to structure your\nwriting appropriately. There's more on this area later in this LEAP Online section.\n\n\n\n\n In the next section we will explore different genres and\n      writing styles used at the University of Bolton.\n\n\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                  University of Bolton 2023\n                                             4\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\nGenres and Writing Styles\n\n\n\n\nAs part of the writing process, you will need to consider the genre of writing e.g., an\nessay and the writing style e.g., a reflective essay, including the structure and format\nof the same.\n\nUniversity of Bolton students will be asked to write using different genres and writing\nstyles, including, but not limited to:\n\n   \u2022   Essay writing\n   \u2022   Reflective essay\n   \u2022   Report writing\n   \u2022   Descriptive writing\n   \u2022   Comparative analysis/evaluation\n   \u2022   Argumentative writing\n\nLet\u2019s look at the different genres and writing styles above in more detail.\n\n\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                   University of Bolton 2023\n                                           5\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\nEssay writing\n1. Definition\n\nAccording to Cottrell (2019) an essay is defined as an assignment that is intended to\nfocus your reading and thinking on a specific area. Often, you will engage in a critical\nanalysis on a topic area that will require you to present your position on the topic by\nforming a compelling argument.\n\n\n\n2. Purpose\n\n   \u2022   Essays will allow you to:\n   \u2022   Present your ideas on a subject\n   \u2022   Elaborate on your ideas\n   \u2022   Develop your communication skills\n   \u2022   Write with greater precision\n   \u2022   Develop writing skills that will support you at University and in work-related\n       contexts.\n\nAs you progress through your studies, the standard of expectations on essay writing\nwill rise and may include more complex subjects that will challenge your higher order\nthinking skills e.g., to critically analyse. (Cottrell, 2019)\n\n\n\n3. Structure\n\nThe structure often derives from the genre of writing (English Academic Purpose,\n2021). Generally, if you're asked to write an essay, it should include an introduction,\nwith the main body separated into focused paragraphs, finishing with a conclusion.\nGenerally, organisational features, such as bullet points and subheadings are\nexcluded.\n\n\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                     University of Bolton 2023\n                                               6\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\n4. Preliminaries\n\nTitle page\n\nPurpose\n\nStudents at the University of Bolton are expected to include a title page that contains\nkey information that helps the reader to identify the contents and author of their work.\n\nStructure\n\nGenerally, a title page should include the following information: Programme name\n\nModule title Assessment title Your student number Your marking tutor Date of\nsubmission\n\nAlways check with your Module Tutor to ensure all information has been included.\n\n\n\n5. Introduction\n\nSome experienced academic writers believe writing an introduction can be the\nhardest part and, although it is found at the beginning, it is often easier to complete\nthis part last to make sure all key points are included.\n\nPurpose\n\nIn short, when writing your introduction, it should:\n\n   \u2022   Outline the direction of your assignment and argument\n   \u2022   Provide contextual and background information on the topic\n   \u2022   Explain the overall structure\n\nStructure\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that there is no one way to structure your introduction, but\nmost will include the following parts.\n\n\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                   University of Bolton 2023\n                                            7\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\n Part                               Details\n General Statement                      \u2022   Usually found at the beginning of the\n                                            introduction.\n                                        \u2022   Will help you to introduce the general topic\n                                            and give the reader contextual and\n                                            background information.\n                                        \u2022   If you\u2019re writing a short essay, this may\n                                            include 1 or 2 lines.\n                                        \u2022   For longer essays, you may choose to\n                                            include definitions, outline the main topic\n                                            and separate over 1 or more paragraphs.\n\n\n Thesis Statement                       \u2022   Usually found at the end of the\n                                            introduction.\n                                        \u2022   Will help you to give the reader clear\n                                            information about the content of your\n                                            essay.\n                                        \u2022   Will help you to outline your main ideas on\n                                            the topic and your stance/ argument.\n                                        \u2022   It may also include an outline, as detailed\n                                            below.\n\n Outline                                \u2022   Will help you to explain to the reader how\n                                            your assignment will be structured e.g. in\n                                            chronological order.\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n[General statement] The introduction is an important component of any genre of\nacademic writing.

The main body of your essay must include well-constructed\nparagraphs. For more information on structuring your paragraphs, see the next\nsection, \u2018Putting it all together\u2019\n\n\n\n7. Conclusion\n\nIn contrast to the introduction, the conclusion should be relatively straightforward. By\nthis point in the writing process, your main ideas and argument should already be set\nout in the main body of your essay. Therefore, all you need to do is summarise your\nessay and add a concluding comment on the topic.\n\nPurpose\n\n   \u2022   To bring all of your main ideas together and set out your overall position\n   \u2022   Highlight gaps or weaknesses and make recommendations for future\n       research\n\n\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                   University of Bolton 2023\n                                           9\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\nStructure\n\n Summarise your essay                 \u2022   Have a clear transitional signal.

Definition\n\nDraws on personal experiences by critically analysing an experience, demonstrating\nhow it affected you, linking back to theory.\n\n\n\n2. Purpose\n\nDuring your time at the University of Bolton, it is most likely you will be required to\nwrite a reflective essay, in which you reflect on academic or work-based placements,\nevaluate an experiment or simply a reflection on literature that links theory to\npractice. However, it can often to prove difficult to write about your feelings and be\ncritical of your actions.\n\nThis piece of work will allow you to reflect on an event and demonstrate to the\naudience what you have learnt from it. It is an opportunity for you to explain what\nhappened, briefly express your feelings and what you have learnt and how you could\ndo things differently next time.\n\nNeedless to say, therefore, this style of writing will not only help you in an academic\ncontext, but develop important skills that will support you in your chosen profession\nonce you commence employment.\n\n\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                     University of Bolton 2023\n                                            11\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\n3. Writing Styles\n\nReflective essays include a number of styles, including:\n\nCritical\nInclude academic reasoning on your experience and how it relates to theory or\nprofessional practice\n\nDescriptive\nDescribe, succinctly your experience.\n\nEvaluative\nThis may include an evaluation of your role.\n\nAnalytical\nChoose and explain key events during your experience.\n\n\n\n4. Choose a Topic\n\nBefore you begin to structure your assignment, you need to choose a topic.\nRemember, although you\u2019re writing about a personal experience, it is still a formal\npiece of academic writing that needs to meet the assignment brief. Therefore, you\nneed to choose a topic that achieves this objective and allows you to write a strong\npiece of work. To help you choose a topic, you may wish to consider the following:\n\n   \u2022   Is the topic relevant? If not, perhaps it\u2019s one to avoid.\n   \u2022   Does the topic relate to theory? If so, you can write about how your\n       experience links back to existing literature.\n   \u2022   Did you learn something? If so, write about what you learnt as long as it links\n       back to the topic.\n   \u2022   Were you inspired? Did the topic inspire you, but you can still write about it\n       critically?\n   \u2022   Can the topic be analysed? For instance, are there different debates around\n       the topic you can write about?\n\n\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                        University of Bolton 2023\n                                            12\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\n5. Structure\n\nYour assignment brief may ask you to consider a certain model of reflection. There\nare various models, all of which help you to reflect but may have different sections.\nFor the purpose of this Tutorial, Gibbs (1988) has been used. Other models include\nDriscoll (1994) that considers \u2018What? So What? Now What?\u2019 whereby, if you use this\nmodel, you will need to structure your assignment slightly differently. As a general\nrule, always check your assignment brief to see whether you have been instructed to\nuse a certain model of reflection.\n\nGibbs (1988) considers six stages of reflection, all of which will help you to structure\nyour assignment. These are:\n\n\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                   University of Bolton 2023\n                                           13\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\n6.

For instance, how did you and those around you\n       react?\n   \u2022   What was good and bad about the experience?\n   \u2022   Were there any limits, implications or lessons to be learnt? If so, how did\n       these affect you?\n   \u2022   Link back to theory\n\n\n\n10. Analysis\n\nYou might want to comment on the following:\n\n   \u2022   Follows your evaluation\n   \u2022   You might want to comment on why the event took place\n   \u2022   Did anything help or hinder the situation?\n   \u2022   Link back to theory\n\n\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                   University of Bolton 2023\n                                          15\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\n11. Conclusion\n\nYou might want to comment on the following:\n\n   \u2022   What you could have done differently\n   \u2022   If the experience was negative, is there anything you would do to avoid the\n       situation from happening or prevent it from happening again?\n   \u2022   If the experience was positive, would you do the same next time? Are there\n       any long-term effects?\n   \u2022   Link to theories, if necessary\n\n\n\n12. Action Plan\n\nYou might want to comment on the following:\n\n   \u2022   The Action Plan will summarise any action you will need to take for next time\n   \u2022   State what you learnt. Did you take anything away from the experience?\n   \u2022   What is the broader significance? Are there any lessons to be learnt from your\n       experience that affects the profession of your programme, for students or\n       existing theories?\n   \u2022   Do you need to attend additional training to support your learning?\n   \u2022   Do you need to seek advice from your mentor?\n   \u2022   If the situation arises again, will you be in a better position to cope with it?\n\n\n\n13. Be Critical\n\nIt is important to draw on your personal reflection critically, by:\n\n   \u2022   Not being too descriptive e.g., don\u2019t write a story about an event.\n   \u2022   Using your experience as a starting point, but don\u2019t forget to branch out into\n       your reading and include theories\n   \u2022   State whether your experience is common or uncommon?\n   \u2022   You want to be critical but you should maintain confidentiality. For example, if\n       you\u2019re a Trainee Teacher or student Nurse, ensure you delete names of\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                     University of Bolton 2023\n                                            16\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\n       students, patients and/or Trusts, etc. you work at. If you\u2019re unsure, always\n       check with your Module Tutor.\n\n\n\n14. Useful Tips\n\n   \u2022   Be selective \u2013 you can\u2019t include everything\n   \u2022   Avoid irrelevance; use examples which link to wider reading, which are\n       relevant to the assignment brief\n   \u2022   Limit your emotions. If needed, be critical about your experience, but avoid\n       emotional outpourings\n   \u2022   Personal pronouns, such as \u2018I,\u2019 \u2018me\u2019 and \u2018my\u2019 can be used Avoid repetition\n   \u2022   Demonstrate self-awareness and an awareness for others\n\n\n\n15.

Definition\n\nSynthesising is a useful academic skill that will help you with analytical writing. To\nSynthesise, it will involve combining ideas from multiple sources in your work. Unlike\nparaphrasing, which focuses on one author (or idea/ academic source), synthesising\nwill draw on a range of academic sources to find ideas that are similar or\ncontradictory to establish a new idea to support your argument.\n\n\n\n2. Purpose\n\nSynthesising will help you to explain ideas from multiple sources or draw together\nparticular themes or traits. It will also help you to develop and strength your\nargument(s), demonstrate you have read widely on the topic and cite and reference\nmultiple sources.\n\n\n\n3. How to Synthesise\n\nStep 1: Read\n\nYou should find and read relevant source material.\n\nStep 2: Note-take\n\nMake notes on all sources you use in your own words.\n\nStep 3: Cite and reference\n\nYou must cite and reference all source material used in your writing.\n\nStep 4: Create a grid\n\nUsing a new Microsoft Word document insert a table (on Word select \u2018insert,\u2019 \u2018table\u2019\nand choose how many grids you would like. If you prefer, you can draw a grid on a\npiece of paper using the same method.\n\n\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                    University of Bolton 2023\n                                           27\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\nStep 5: List your ideas\n\nWithin each grid, make a list of the main ideas from each source.\n\nStep 6: Identify themes and arguments\n\nOnce you have done this, try to identify the common themes and arguments from\neach source. If it helps, use different colours to help you do this. Let\u2019s a look at an\nexample.\n\nLearning outcome\n\n\u2018Discuss why in-person learning is important and evaluate its effectiveness as a\nmode of teaching compared to online learning.\u2019\n\nThe below illustration shows where a student has created a grid and made notes on\nfour sources. The student has identified two common themes, being:\n\n   1. Meaningful interactions and activities\n   2.

You will note how \u2018Theorist D\u2019 has a different idea around\n\u2018Meaningful Interactions and activities,\u2019 compared to the other Theorists. These ideas\ncan now be combined into a paragraph to support your argument.

If it doesn\u2019t, revisit your plan and\n       amend accordingly\n   \u2022   Once you\u2019ve sequenced your ideas, discuss the order with a peer to get their\n       thoughts and to make sure they can follow your work.\n\n\n\n\n              See the Academic Cohesion tutorial of this LEAP Online section for\n              more information.\n\n\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                   University of Bolton 2023\n                                          32\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\nParagraphs\nA paragraph, which is made up of a set of sentences, will help you to develop your\nidea and support your overall argument.\n\nParagraphs are an effective way to break up the text into manageable blocks for the\naudience, allowing them to see how your writing develops step-by-step. Some useful\ntechniques you can consider when preparing a paragraph include:\n\n1. Paragraph Introduction\n\nYou can start each paragraph with a topic sentence. For example, you may wish to\noutline the intention of the paragraph and argument. This will help to signal the\npurpose of the paragraph and provide the audience with an easy transition from the\nprevious paragraph.\n\n\n\n2. Paragraph Main Body\n\nThe main body of your paragraph should be used to explain the topic (which was\nintroduced at the beginning). Evidence should be used to support your argument and\nto give your interpretation of research.\n\n\n\n3. Paragraph Conclusion\n\nConclude your paragraph by linking your idea to the overall argument you\u2019re trying to\nmake and transition to the next paragraph.\n\n\n\nYour paragraph can be developed using the following techniques:\n\n\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                  University of Bolton 2023\n                                           33\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\n1. TEEL\n\nThe TEEL strategy is a good way to ensure your writing is well organised and easy\nto follow. TEEL stands for:\n\nTopic Sentence\n\nAs demonstrated above under \u2018Paragraph Introduction\u2019 a Topic Sentence will allow\nyou to outline the main idea of the paragraph.\n\nExplain\n\nThis is an opportunity for you to explain why your main point is important and\nsupports your overall argument.\n\nEvidence\n\nProvide evidence to support your main point. Ensure you cite and reference\nappropriately.\n\nLink\n\nUsually optional, but as demonstrated under \u2018Paragraph Conclusion\u2019 above, it will\nhelp to link your idea to the overall argument. Furthermore, it is also an effective way\nof transitioning to the next paragraph.\n\n\n\n2. Chronological Organisation\n\nHelps to describe a series of events, steps or observations that occur in time. For\nexample, if you were asked to write an essay about the history of education in the\nUK since the beginning of the twentieth century, you would begin with its conception\n(say, 1900    and outline significant events up to present day.\n\n\n\n\n3. Spatial Organisation\n\nHelps the audience to visualise an idea as you want them to see it, evoke the\naudience\u2019s senses and is often used in descriptive essays. For example, if you were\nasked to write an essay describing objects you would find on a hospital ward, you\n\nLEAP Online                                                   University of Bolton 2023\n                                           34\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\nmay choose to describe the items as they appear when observed. This approach will\nhelp you to create a vivid picture for the reader.\n\nWhen should I start a new paragraph?\n\n1. New Idea or Point\n\nYou should start a new paragraph when you begin a new idea or point. If your idea\nextends over several paragraphs, each new point within that idea should have its\nown paragraph.\n\n2. To Demonstrate Contrast\n\nYou can also start a new paragraph if you want to demonstrate a contrast between\ninformation or ideas. Separate paragraphs will help to contrast the different sides of\na debate, different points of an argument, or any other difference.\n\n3. The Audience Needs a Pause\n\nParagraphs also act as a short break for the audience. Adding a \u201cpause\u201d will help the\naudience to follow your argument. It\u2019s a good idea to add a \u201cpause\u201d if your paragraph\nis becoming too lengthy or complex.\n\n\n\n\nTransition Signals\nHelp to signal the relationship between ideas and help the audience to follow your\nargument effectively.\n\n\n           See the Academic Cohesion tutorial of this LEAP Online section for\n           more information.\n\n\n\n\nIn the next section we will explore the value of evidence\n                in your academic writing.\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                  University of Bolton 2023\n                                           35\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\nEvidence\n\n\n\n\nEvidence is an important feature of academic writing that helps to support your\nopinion and argument. Evidence may include:\n\n   \u2022   Data and statistics\n   \u2022   Examples\n   \u2022   Facts\n   \u2022   Citations\n\nUsing evidence will add substance to your work, allows the audience to see you\nhave undertaken thorough research and helps to support your understanding of\ndifferent concepts and theories. Unless evidence is used in your writing, it may be\nconsidered unreliable or bias.\n\nRemember, you must cite and reference sources appropriately. Failure to do this\nmay result in issues with plagiarism and academic misconduct.\n\n\n\n\n           To learn how cite and reference according to your school\u2019s\n           referencing policy see the \u2018Referencing\u2019 section on LEAP Online for\n           more information.\n\n\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                 University of Bolton 2023\n                                          36\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\nLanguage\n\n\n\n\nBe Concise\n   \u2022   Try and limit it to one point, per sentence.\n   \u2022   Try to use succinct sentences where possible to avoid your point becoming\n       lost in long, complex sentences. For example, \"a man by the the name of\n       Alexander Graham Bell invited... \" would become \"Bell invited...\n\n\n\n\nUse Formal Language\nFor formal academic writing assignments, you should avoid:\n\n1. Colloquialisms\n\nAn informal word or expression that is often used in everyday speech. For example,\n\"Donald (2022) ought [ought being the colloquialism] to be more specific regarding...\"\ncan be replaced with \"There is an opportunity for Donald (2022) to be more specific\nregarding...\"\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                 University of Bolton 2023\n                                           37\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\n2. Contractions\n\nThe result of combining two words together, using an apostrophe. For example, the\nphrase, \u2018This isn\u2019t the case\u2019 should be presented as \u2018this is not the case.\u2019\n\n\n\n3. Clich\u00e9s\n\nHave a general meaning or overused and no longer has a meaning. For example,\nthe phrase, \u2018read between the lines,\u2019 can be replaced with, \u2018implicitly.\u2019\n\n\n\n\nAbbreviation\nUse abbreviations where the phrase is likely to appear frequently in your paper.

So, don\u2019t be afraid to\nbe critical! Give your opinion but make sure it\u2019s supported with evidence.\n\n\n\n\n           Useful tip\n\n           Your argument should be detailed throughout your writing. Keep\n           referring to your plan because this will help you to keep focused as\n           you write your assignment. See the 'Critical Thinking' section on\n           LEAP Online for more information.\n\n\n\n\nBe Precise\nUse clear and precise language. You may need to use specialist words in your\nwriting but define this vocabulary if it is not commonly used, or you need to\ndemonstrate understanding to the audience. Here are some useful tips:\n\n   \u2022   Try to pre-empt some of the questions the reader may ask when they read\n       your work. Below is a table of general language, with some questions and\n       synonyms, which will help you become more precise with your writing\n   \u2022   Always link the argument back to the learning outcomes\n\n\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                  University of Bolton 2023\n                                          42\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\n General           Specific\n\n      Big          Can you give a number, size or percentage?

Present both sides of the argument and demonstrate\nthe strengths and weaknesses of these claims. This can be achieved by using\ntechniques, such as hedges, boosters and reporting verbs.\n\n\n\n\n             See 'Paraphrasing' and 'Other Writing Skills' tutorials of this LEAP\n             Online section for more information.\n\n\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                    University of Bolton 2023\n                                            43\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\nObjective\nThe active voice is used to describe the action, using possessive adjectives and\nsubject pronouns, such as: \u2018my,\u2019 \u2018our,\u2019 \u2018I\u2019 and \u2018we.\u2019\n\nHowever, in your academic writing, emphasis should be placed on your writing,\nrather than you. Therefore, using a passive voice will help you to avoid writing as the\nfirst-person.\n\nUnless you are instructed otherwise, an impersonal approach, also commonly\nreferred to as the third-person view, should be used in your writing.\n\n\n\n                                           Pause and Reflect\n\n                                           Let's look at an example:\n\n                                           The sentence below has been written in an\n                                           active voice, consider how this could be\n                                           rewritten in a passive voice.\n\n                                           \"In this essay, I aim to examine theories on\n                                           academic writing.\"\n\n                                           When you're ready, see our solution below.\n\n\n\nOur solution\n\n\"Academic writing theories will be examined in this essay.\"\n\n\n\nWhen you compare the passive example to the active example, you will notice how:\nThe sentence structure has changed, the word 'I' has been removed and the word\n'examine' has been changed to 'examined'. Don't worry too much about this for now\nas the Paraphrasing tutorial will provide more information on sentence structure and\nhow to change the active and passive voice.\n\n\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                     University of Bolton 2023\n                                            44\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\n\nThis section has considered the definition of academic writing and the 6 key features\nof writing success, being:\n\n   \u2022   Clear Focus and Planning\n   \u2022   Audience\n   \u2022   Genres and Writing Styles\n   \u2022   Evidence\n   \u2022   Language\n   \u2022   Voice\n\n\n\n\nWhere to go to next\nBefore you leave, select the button below to complete a short assessment and earn\nyour LEAP Online digital badge.\n\nOnce you have completed the assessment, close the tab, return to the 'Academic\nWriting - Level 2' LEAP Online section and begin the next tutorial.\n\n\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                  University of Bolton 2023\n                                          45\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\nDigital Bage\nBefore you leave, select the button below to complete a short assessment and earn\nyour LEAP Online digital badge.\n\nAcademic Writing: An Introduction to Academic Writing?\n\nMoodle assessment\n\n\n\n\n          For more support on this topic, consider attending a free workshop at\n          LEAP Live.\n\n\n\n\nLEAP Online                                                University of Bolton 2023\n                                        46\n\fAn Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n\nReference List\nAlexander, O., Argent, S. and Spencer, J.
